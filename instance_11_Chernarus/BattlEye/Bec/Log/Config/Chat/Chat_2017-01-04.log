10:25:16 : Side: Headshot: i like to buy a new sniper from someone :p
10:25:31 : Side: Turmoil: what kind of sniper are you looking for?
10:25:51 : Side: Headshot: a laupa or a m107 <3 
10:26:16 : Side: Turmoil: i also want the m107, but it eludes me... i think sierra has hidden it in the deepest forest 
10:26:23 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I had one a m107 on me last night for the event :D
10:26:43 : Side: Sierra [SD]: should have come and killed me! :D
10:26:48 : Side: Headshot: darn :p 
10:26:55 : Side: Turmoil: great, now the airfield will never be safe Sierra -_-
10:26:59 : Side: Turmoil: lol
10:27:12 : Side: Headshot: truh :p
10:27:30 : Side: Sierra [SD]: hee hee :D - you can buy them anyways - they are just not easy to find
10:27:32 : Side: Turmoil: 2DIE4 always camps out down there hunting unsuspecting people xD
10:27:44 : Side: Sierra [SD]: xD
10:27:55 : Side: Turmoil: yeah i know, i just need to get to Hero status
10:28:11 : Side: Sierra [SD]: what is your humanity?
10:28:11 : Side: Turmoil: i died so many times just not to loose my points xD
10:28:20 : Side: Turmoil: 4420 :D
10:28:25 : Side: Sierra [SD]: not far off then!
10:28:32 : Side: Turmoil: only by killing zombies... 5 points each time
10:28:51 : Side: Sierra [SD]: go kill a few bandits at a mission :D
10:29:06 : Side: Turmoil: might leave all my gear and just take a sniper and do that yeah
10:29:07 : Side: Headshot: still got 1k to go for being a hero :p but cant wait te get a decent long range sniper rifel 
10:29:53 : Side: Turmoil: headshot, i can see what i got when i get to my stash, maybe i have something :)
10:29:54 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yeah - M24's tend to go pew pew - they are alright tho if you have nothing better around :D
10:30:12 : Side: Sierra [SD]: have found a couple of dmr's too though
10:30:22 : Side: Turmoil: Lapua and M40 are  quite okay i think
10:30:35 : Side: Headshot: if someone want to traide let me know ^^ 
10:30:45 : Side: Turmoil: i also used the SR25 out too 600+ m without problem
10:30:48 : Side: Sierra [SD]: not so keen on the lapua myself because of the reload time but each to their own :D
10:31:12 : Side: Turmoil: i mostly used the M40 for decent access to ammo xD
10:31:26 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yeah - I prefer to be 1000m + away lol - I'm a scaredy cat! :D
10:31:34 : Side: Sierra [SD]: xD
10:31:58 : Side: Turmoil: same here... thats why i want M107 :D
10:32:04 : Side: Sierra [SD]: :D
10:32:17 : Side: Turmoil: only negative side effect is the noise it makes i supose... 
10:32:24 : Side: Turmoil: and expensive ammo
10:32:54 : Side: Headshot: lol not bad 
10:32:57 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yup but if you pick a good out of the way spot you are usually pretty safe. Yes there is that...
10:33:17 : Side: Turmoil: a good ghillie and a bush <
10:33:38 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yup! xD
10:34:21 : Side: Turmoil: do you loose humanity if you kill other players even tho they are bandits?
10:34:42 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I don't think you do if they are bandits - but its hard to tell who is a bandit

11:06:09 : Side: Turmoil: anyone in your TS atm? the one im in is empty and i feel alone, lol
11:06:46 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Only me for help requests but its a bit tricky for me to chat properly in the day because I'm working - I can chat in the evenings though usually
11:07:07 : Side: Turmoil: working? but your on here? xD
11:07:29 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I'm only typing to you guys - not playing
11:07:46 : Side: Turmoil: ooooh, i see... so if i find you i can kill you?
11:07:56 : Side: Sierra [SD]: good luck finding me :P
11:08:04 : Side: Turmoil: admin priviliges i supose
11:08:23 : Side: Turmoil: hiding in some remote area under a bush with a ghillie
11:09:01 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yup - when I am only on admining and not playing. I don't use them when I am playing for obvious reasons :D
11:09:14 : Side: Sierra [SD]: not to mention that the game would be super boring too
11:09:53 : Side: Turmoil: yeah, i was admin on WarZ/Infestation back in the day... admin powers makes the game super boring if you use them to your advantage ^^ lol
11:10:39 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yeah I don't get why people would want to use them tbh - there would be no point in playing. I always play as a hero too and don't kill players when I
11:10:56 : Side: Sierra [SD]: i am playing because people always accuse of admin abuse otherwise
11:11:28 : Side: Turmoil: i know the feeling... i do the same even tho im not an admin, i mostly just like helping people out, like headshot ^^
11:11:51 : Side: Turmoil: and like i said yesterday, i really suck at PvP :D lol
11:12:04 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yeah - I'm a friendly kind of player anyway - I'm not really aggressive. I also suck at pvp :D
11:13:25 : Side: Turmoil: is that you headshot? ^^
11:13:59 : Direct: Headshot: yup ^^ 
11:14:15 : Direct: Turmoil: selling cars? xD
11:14:40 : Direct: Headshot: that blau car was from a mission stransng after restart ist still here :p 
11:14:46 : Direct: Headshot: yup ^^ 
11:15:00 : Direct: Turmoil: nice way to make money, especially when you got the heli
11:15:02 : Direct: Headshot: bus diddent steel dis one fairly earnt by a mission ^^ 
11:15:17 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah ^^ 
11:15:26 : Direct: Headshot: if you like a ride you just heave to shout ^^ 
11:15:35 : Direct: Turmoil: will do ^^ 
11:18:17 : Side: Turmoil: how does the fuel trucks work? can you just park one at your location and refuel veichles and helis?
11:18:43 : Side: Headshot: yeah
11:18:57 : Side: Sierra [SD]: think you might need a generator
11:19:03 : Side: Headshot: nope
11:19:19 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah ok - there you go then - must have changed it
11:19:37 : Side: Turmoil: sounds kinda sweet... is there any limit to how many transports you can own in the server?
11:19:55 : Side: Headshot: just let the Engine run from the feul truk en park your viciel next to it 
11:20:20 : Side: Headshot: scroll en then you see refill vic
11:20:21 : Side: Sierra [SD]: no not really - the more locked ones people have, the less spawn though..
11:20:53 : Side: Turmoil: alright ^^
11:21:10 : Side: Turmoil: i mostly end up using my pickup xD gotta learn how to fly soon i supose
11:22:09 : Side: Sierra [SD]: have you tried setting up a fuel pump lately Headshot? I presume you still need a generator for that...
11:22:27 : Side: Turmoil: yeah you do... if you want to fill barrels etc
11:22:33 : Side: Turmoil: at stations without car
11:22:46 : Side: Headshot: fuel pumps yup but the feul truks you cen use there angine's ^^ 
11:23:02 : Side: Sierra [SD]: righty - cool. I havent tried out everything on the new Epoch yet:D
11:24:03 : Side: Crow: When you are bambi and you just want to see where that heli is going but you know you'd get killed xD
11:24:13 : Side: Sierra [SD]: awww lol :D
11:24:47 : Side: Headshot: where you at need a ride ? 
11:25:11 : Side: Turmoil: the cycle of DayZ... getting killed 
11:25:32 : Side: Turmoil: wish more people werent backstabbers, lol.. but i guess thats just a part of the gamew
11:26:00 : Side: Sierra [SD]: everyone is different xD
11:26:35 : Side: Turmoil: yeah... did a mission the other day, a guy joined us and when we were finsihed he shot us at took the loot xD 
11:26:39 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I wonder how accurate a reflection it is of how people are in real life.
11:26:54 : Side: Sierra [SD]: obviously minus the shooting everyone of course! ;P
11:27:47 : Side: Crow: Well I watched frankie and some other streamers which made me buy this and I hate backstabers.. I'm friendly chap who doesn't know how things work xD
11:29:05 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Yeah I'm friendly - as I was saying earlier I never kill other players - not just because I am admin but also because I just don't play that way.
11:30:00 : Side: Crow: Ye I know the feel
11:30:28 : Side: [LPI] John lancepierre: bandits are pussy its easy to kill, its harder to be friendly we never know who we meet
11:30:52 : Side: Sierra [SD]: It's definately harder to become a hero.
11:31:19 : Side: Sierra [SD]: But each to their own, I know everyone likes a different style of gameplay
11:32:54 : Side: Turmoil: someone come to Norway and take out the lady above me... -_-
11:33:27 : Side: Crow: if I had money for trip no probs
11:33:33 : Side: Turmoil: xD
11:33:57 : Side: Crow: anyway got to run I'll come back to this server! Later!
11:33:58 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I'm going to be off screen for a while now but if anyone needs anything important just hop on the teamspeak and one of us will try and reply as 
11:33:59 : Side: Turmoil: old lady, christan artist and writer, anti technology... but she uses the comp for downloading soundbooks... wich fucks me up while playing
11:34:03 : Side: Sierra [SD]: quickly as we see you.
11:34:14 : Side: Turmoil: have fun working :D
11:34:24 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I'll stay logged in just incase. oh yes i shall :D
11:34:38 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Good gaming all! :)

11:46:08 : Side: Sierra [SD]: just a bug I think
11:46:28 : Side: Sierra [SD]: You have to run just outside your plot sometimes
11:47:51 : Side: Sierra [SD]: there is prob not much you can do about it.
11:48:06 : Side: Sierra [SD]: atm
11:48:09 : Side: 2DIE4:  well   ok  then 
11:48:59 : Side: Sierra [SD]: its a bit of a pain keep dismantling the plot though isnt it
11:49:57 : Side: Sierra [SD]: it would have been helpful if it had been fixed for the new Epoch really 
11:50:15 : Side: 2DIE4: indeed
11:50:49 : Side: Sierra [SD]: still alot of bugs and issues to be ironed out. xD
11:54:44 : Side: 2DIE4: oops

12:17:39 : Side: Turmoil: thats why i dont kill everything at least xD + i suck
12:18:14 : Side: 2DIE4: well eventhough i might kill on sight i usually let ppl take their shit back unless they got some i really need

12:18:43 : Side: Turmoil: or want, i supose... or do you let em keep a briefcase with 100gold? xD
12:18:53 : Side: 2DIE4:  if u got the right ammo ill tkae it  but the rest usually stays

12:19:49 : Side: 2DIE4: only if i got stuck and have no other choice or the do it  in  aa way thats just needs to be punished 
12:20:02 : Side: 2DIE4:  i like to watch ppl and how they approach their goal

12:57:14 : Side: OdlBrodler: maybe the m2 from the mission
12:57:31 : Side: OdlBrodler: these guys are sometimes shooting over 1500m
12:57:33 : Side: Turmoil: they are usually more accurate xD
12:58:47 : Side: Marco: i found that it's usually sort of safe to engage M2's from about 900m if you have some sort of cover.
12:59:38 : Side: Marco: mil dots on M40 are 50 or 100m?
13:00:05 : Side: Marco: or depending on zoom?
