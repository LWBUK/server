09:19:02 : Side: Replicate: ?
09:19:12 : Side: Turmoil: you can do them both :)
09:19:39 : Side: Turmoil: but if you are Hero and do Hero mission you lose humanity, if you are Hero and do Bandit mission you gain humanity from killing the bandits
09:58:25 : Side: [GOC] hairy: hi guys
09:58:46 : Side: Turmoil: hey
10:11:42 : Side: Manni: ö
10:18:52 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Hello :). How is everyone getting on. You all ok?
10:19:00 : Side: Turmoil: depends...

10:19:19 : Side: Sierra [SD]: why what's up?
10:19:38 : Side: Turmoil: im renting above me lives a crazy lady that i want to kill... xD lol
10:19:47 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah I see :D
10:19:48 : Side: Faldehals: i like to know with how much plotpoles i can build a base
10:20:29 : Side: Sierra [SD]: You mean how big you are allowed to build your base in other words?
10:20:38 : Side: Faldehals: ja
10:21:51 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Righty - 2 plot poles. You cannot put another one within 60m of your original one I believe anyway
10:22:30 : Side: Turmoil: two is the max? thats per person right? ^^
10:22:55 : Side: Sierra [SD]: per site
10:23:12 : Side: Faldehals: we are 2 ppls and i need 3 for this what i like to do
10:23:48 : Side: Turmoil: but if you are several people who build your own base then? but in close proximity of eachother? :D
10:24:06 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Well yes there isnt much we can do about that :P
10:24:25 : Side: Turmoil: nice, got a bit worried there xD
10:24:34 : Side: Sierra [SD]: like i said I think you cant build within 60m anyway :)
10:25:02 : Side: Faldehals: ill try it with 3 and im sure you like what i do if it works 
10:25:04 : Side: Turmoil: VSS, tought that was 2DIE4 when i saw the kill message xD loool
10:25:32 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Well that is upto you but if LWB decides to remove it I cannot do much about that :)
10:25:42 : Side: Faldehals: what happen with walls they are not in range ?
10:25:56 : Side: Turmoil: cant place em i supose?
10:26:09 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yeah
10:26:32 : Side: Sierra [SD]: it will come up with a message
10:26:37 : Side: [GOC] hairy: where ya get build things from 
10:26:42 : Side: Turmoil: you can see who placed each plot pole right? 
10:26:55 : Side: Sierra [SD]: missions or the building trader. Yeah we can
10:26:57 : Side: Turmoil: when you run around checking stuff and doing your admin things
10:27:02 : Side: Turmoil: xD

10:27:48 : Side: Faldehals: hey hey my stuff is secret mkay
10:28:11 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I'm always working :). I just log in to see if anyone needs anything
10:28:20 : Side: Faldehals: TOP secret
10:28:34 : Side: Sierra [SD]: :P
10:28:35 : Side: Turmoil: you must have the best job in the world tho xD checking in on games whilst working
10:29:54 : Side: Sierra [SD]: :P. It's our own business so there is no one to tell me off :P
10:30:40 : Side: Turmoil: lol, need a new employee? hahaha xD my current boss is an ass so 
10:30:48 : Side: Turmoil: a bit far to drive each day i supose
10:30:55 : Side: Sierra [SD]: haha :D - yeah would be a bit of a trek!
10:31:22 : Side: Turmoil: i assume you do some sort of computing since your always online? 
10:32:22 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I work on a computer - I do the office side of things with the business.
10:32:57 : Side: [GOC] hairy: iam rusty as 
10:33:13 : Side: Turmoil: ah, okay.. well then i prefere my own job xD i dont like office work, even tho i guess its cool enough with DayZ 
10:34:01 : Side: Sierra [SD]: :D - well when its your own business you kind of have to manage the office work somehow!
10:34:23 : Side: Turmoil: true true... at least you dont get cold in the winter time xD i fix broken cars, wich really sucks in wintertime
10:35:42 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Ah cool :D. We collect garage & industrial waste so when you've done an oil or filter change..... :D
10:36:37 : Side: Turmoil: well, i mostly do the bodywork part ^^ but i do change oil and filters on occasions :D
10:36:54 : Side: Turmoil: and break fluids if theres damage to the breaks 
10:37:10 : Side: Turmoil: Brakes*** that was a bad typo 
10:37:40 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah I see :D. I don't mind getting hands on with things. I do have to go and do stuff around the work yard too, but I'm mainly in the office.
10:39:19 : Side: Turmoil: i actually got that... umm, dylecsia? problems writing/reading, especially written/writing stuff by hand
10:39:45 : Side: Turmoil: dyslecsia? not sure how its called in english
10:40:11 : Side: Sierra [SD]: oh yes. That must make things a little difficult sometimes. dyslexia
10:40:12 : Side: Turmoil: so office is not for me xD
10:40:50 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Are you good with latin? because they say people with dyslexia find latin easy to learn because of it being phonetically sounded.
10:40:53 : Side: Turmoil: funny part is that computer typing is NO problem at all :D reading might be sometimes if there is ALOT of text but
10:41:03 : Side: Turmoil: never tried actually... 
10:41:20 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah right - might be interesting to find out! :) 
10:41:37 : Side: Turmoil: yeah i might look into that, perhaps i can learn a new language
10:41:58 : Side: Sierra [SD]: xD - I haven't done latin for years so I've forgotten most of it.
10:42:06 : Side: Sierra [SD]: if you don't use it you loose it!
10:42:59 : Side: Turmoil: i suppose that's how it is with every language... i usually fu** up with english alot also if i havent used it in a while
10:43:29 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Yeah I expect so. You speak english very well. Alot better than I speak Norwegian ;)
10:44:12 : Side: Sierra [SD]: By this of course I mean that I don't :P - it is one of the languages I would like to learn though.
10:44:40 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Your english is better than a lot of british people :D
10:44:48 : Side: Turmoil: haha thanks ^^ 
10:44:54 : Side: Turmoil: you should learn norwegian xD
10:45:49 : Side: Sierra [SD]: maybe I will try. xD
10:46:23 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Do you mind me asking how old you are?
10:46:23 : Side: Turmoil: many foreigners struggle with it becouse the extra letters we got tho
10:46:33 : Side: Turmoil: not at all, im 27 ^^
10:47:04 : Side: Turmoil: old school gamer, lol
10:47:06 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Yes - I would imagine it must take a long time to get to grips with that. Ah ok cool :)
10:47:30 : Side: Faldehals: ppls be careful i got a pink chainsaw :o)
10:47:37 : Side: Turmoil: so do i :D
10:47:42 : Side: Sierra [SD]: sounds dangerous!! :P
10:47:51 : Side: Turmoil: but i cant find the oil for it xD
10:48:07 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yeah that doesnt seem to appear very often
10:48:22 : Side: Turmoil: guess you can buy it maybe? 
10:48:27 : Side: Faldehals: you can bought it but i found it in zombis 2 times
10:49:13 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Well that is quite good going. They have combi locks on them sometimes too which is nice.
10:49:55 : Side: Turmoil: should add in .50 cal automated turrets to protect the bases xD hook em up to a generator...
10:50:21 : Side: Faldehals: is this idk the english name to unlock vehicles to finde ?
10:50:22 : Side: Sierra [SD]: :P - not OP at all! ;)
10:50:32 : Side: Turmoil: not at all xD
10:50:48 : Side: Turmoil: would be nice for harmless people like me tho, also i wouldnt loose humanity xD
10:51:29 : Side: Sierra [SD]: sorry Faldehals, do you mean if you find a locked vehicle can you unlock it?
10:51:42 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yes that is true :)
10:51:52 : Side: Faldehals: there was a item you can finde in zombies to unlock
10:52:04 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah - that is a hotwire kit
10:52:23 : Side: Sierra [SD]: the combi lock is for putting locks on the doors of your base
10:52:30 : Side: Turmoil: can you steal locked cars with that?
10:52:36 : Side: Faldehals: JAA lol i forget the name cause steam change it to german

22:11:56 : Side: SanDWolF: ah god .. alot of servers are unplayable for me even this  i get there max 25fps on De100  40+ ..

22:12:30 : Side: SanDWolF: why it runs so crappy? :D 
22:12:41 : Group: Jesse: not now... 
22:12:47 : Side: Ola: cos your pc is crappy I guess
22:13:12 : Side: SanDWolF: ye its not any Hi-end or aven mid end :D its an old 965 on 4,2 ghz
22:13:52 : Side: Ola: mine isnt great either tbh
22:14:08 : Side: SanDWolF: some servers just have crappy performance i gues bucause i can achieve aroud 40+ on  other servers  
22:14:32 : Side: LWB [SD]: we run on a dedicated 4ghz server with 32 of ram
22:14:44 : Side: LWB [SD]: plus ssd drives for the game and database
22:14:56 : Side: SanDWolF: dayum i  dont know what is wrong

22:15:47 : Side: SanDWolF: btw my frames are lock to 25
22:15:56 : Side: LWB [SD]: it doesnt make much difference to me. I was getting 43fps with it on, I get 45 with it off
22:16:49 : Side: SanDWolF: i was playing arma for loooong time just before it was on steam and all the time i runs it pretty smootlhy  until dayz mod :D
