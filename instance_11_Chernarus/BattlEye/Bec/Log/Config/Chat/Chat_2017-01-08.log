13:55:35 : Side: 2DIE4:  come here pls .... 
13:55:49 : Side: MadafackerESP: the only military bases i know its balota xd
13:55:49 : Side: 2DIE4:  i though building in high loot areas is not allowed?
13:56:03 : Side: Sierra [SD]: building in high loot areas is allowed
13:56:14 : Side: Sierra [SD]: building within 500m of military areas is not allowed
13:56:15 : Side: 2DIE4:  ok fair enough then
13:56:28 : Side: LWB [SD]: Building is restricted in the code. If you can build, its allowed, if its a restricted area, it wont allow you to build
13:56:31 : Side: Sierra [SD]: and the code automatically stops people from doing it
13:56:38 : Side: Sierra [SD]: as LWB says :)
13:56:40 : Side: Turmoil: isnt it just the airfields, safezones and army sites that are illegal to build?

17:57:21 : Side: magnificent: You have to wait 166s
17:57:44 : Side: Turmoil: did you find out the reason why they hacked the server?
17:57:54 : Side: LWB [SD]: cos they are sad morons
17:58:07 : Side: Turmoil: well, that i already knew... dont really get why people would do stuff like that
17:58:26 : Side: LWB [SD]: Script kiddies spending thier christmas money on injectors
17:58:33 : Side: magnificent: admin can u kill me?
17:58:36 : Side: magnificent: i have no gear
17:58:39 : Side: Turmoil: you can do it yourself xD

18:09:44 : Direct: Turmoil: well, thank you very much :) really appreciate it
18:09:49 : Direct: LWB [SD]: Ok np.!
18:16:16 : Side: All: whats the key for the debug monitor?
18:19:56 : Side: Ebse: klen trader buged ?
18:20:09 : Side: LWB [SD]: in what way?
18:20:17 : Side: Ebse: cant trade 
18:20:23 : Side: LWB [SD]: are you a bandit?
18:20:36 : Side: Ebse: dont think so 
18:22:40 : Side: LWB [SD]: yep, its screwed
18:22:57 : Direct: Ebse: ^^
18:23:22 : Side: LWB [SD]: I believe the hacker gotback in, hene why the debug screen just went. I saw him do it and has been banned again, even though he alreday was
18:24:46 : Side: LWB [SD]: looks like he has injected into the server fucntions file and we have lost menus etc
18:24:55 : Side: LWB [SD]: I will need to restart to get them back
18:25:04 : Side: Ebse: wait
18:25:10 : Side: Ebse: we are in save zone 
18:25:16 : Side: Turmoil: restarting now?
18:25:17 : Side: Tobimofat: 30mins
18:25:21 : Side: LWB [SD]: although its working at air trader
18:26:13 : Side: LWB [SD]: and stary is working
18:27:00 : Side: LWB [SD]: and bash is working fine for me
18:28:11 : Side: LWB [SD]: Just Klen is broken it seems
18:28:28 : Direct: Ebse: wait my freind can trade
18:28:43 : Direct: LWB [SD]: maybe its certain people
18:28:57 : Direct: LWB [SD]: Ill try relogging my character and see if it works after
18:31:04 : Direct: LWB [SD]: nope still not working for me
18:31:13 : Direct: lol25: i can trade 
18:31:14 : Direct: LWB [SD]: ah, this one does
18:31:27 : Direct: LWB [SD]: its working now
18:31:30 : Direct: LWB [SD]: werid
18:31:58 : Direct: lol25: yes
18:32:16 : Side: ReaperZA: nice
18:32:33 : Side: ReaperZA: lost 20 gold and 95 silver after being kicked for ping
18:34:55 : Direct: LWB [SD]: hold up reaper
18:35:24 : Direct: LWB [SD]: ok, sorry for the kick
18:35:39 : Direct: LWB [SD]: ok :)
18:36:22 : Side: Turmoil: i think there is something wrong with the clothes as well, im currently not able to change clothes
18:37:12 : Side: Rasmu: ditto
18:37:26 : Side: LWB [SD]: yes, the eroor logs are spamming like mad
18:37:39 : Side: LWB [SD]: This hacker tried to screw us again
18:38:07 : Side: Turmoil: aaaawh... i dont see the point in doing shit like that
18:38:53 : Side: LWB [SD]: pretty sure, I got to him before he did too much damage, but he has distrupted the server functions whislt trying to inject
18:39:54 : Side: Turmoil: wonder why he is so determind to ruin this server
18:40:21 : Side: LWB [SD]: unfourtnetly they target ones with high player counts
18:59:18 : Side: Tobimofat: If a UAZ have 40 armor same as a Humvee, does it mean they are both equal safe
19:00:17 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: wauw simon, you really dont have any guts do you
19:00:28 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: never heard of direct communication?
19:00:30 : Side: LWB [SD]: I guess it depends where the armour is and where it gets hit
19:00:33 : Side: simon: what do you mean?
19:00:40 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: you just killed me
19:00:44 : Side: simon: and?
19:00:47 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: in the firestation at NW
19:00:51 : Side: simon: yes?
19:01:06 : Side: simon: sorry
19:01:10 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: lets say that you may want to run... i got 2 guys with snipers there
19:01:15 : Side: simon: it was an accident

19:49:52 : Side: 2DIE4:  since u managed to lock the vehicle  =) i couldnt get nuttin out ... i placed it  on skalisti island
19:50:20 : Side: 2DIE4:  sry Skalisty island
19:51:01 : Side: Marco: since when you can tow stuff that's locked?
19:51:15 : Side: 2DIE4:  so just go there and get it back then   and remember to lock your stuff if u got the key not all bandits r that nice 
19:51:40 : Side: 2DIE4:  well i towed it and i guess when it was on he manged to lock it b4 i could gain hight
19:51:59 : Side: ReaperZA: nah it was locked the whole time]
19:52:01 : Side: 2DIE4:  sounds plausible?
19:52:06 : Side: Marco: no clue
19:52:11 : Side: ReaperZA: i tried to get in it
19:52:15 : Side: ReaperZA: to stop u
19:52:32 : Side: ReaperZA: but was locked whole time sooo......hmh
19:52:32 : Side: 2DIE4:   u cant tow stuff when locked or maybe i got the tow option on the pickup ... but u know how arma works
19:52:44 : Side: ReaperZA: valid point
19:52:49 : Side: LWB [SD]: the tow script is the buggiest, shittiet mod ever
19:53:01 : Side: 2DIE4:  happend b4    two vehics too close  and then i was wondering y the vehic was locked
19:53:03 : Side: LWB [SD]: you cant tow when locked, except when it decides you can
19:53:25 : Side: 2DIE4:   i know but  one of the vehicles must have been open 
19:54:05 : Side: 2DIE4:  like i said    the wooden floor up by the vehicle dump   2  very close parked i got the option lifted  and at trader it was locked
19:54:27 : Side: 2DIE4: we all know arma does weird stuff
20:09:18 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Hello my little ducklings, I'm back. Everyone ok?
20:18:39 : Side: 2DIE4: like i said the vodnik i on the island
20:32:16 : Side: Phaetta: Where do I find engine parts?
20:32:38 : Side: Sierra [SD]: usually barns, hangers or at the trader.
20:32:59 : Side: Phaetta: oh okaay, thanks
20:33:06 : Side: Sierra [SD]: np :)
20:40:19 : Side: Racer: on airfield i found not loot is this always so

20:44:43 : Side: Racer: i ruuj
20:48:08 : Side: Sierra [SD]: appears to be loot in most of the barracks for me.
20:54:48 : Side: ReaperZA: admin mission spawned on our ass, hardly fair in my opinion, could mission perhaps be removed to retrieve stuff??
