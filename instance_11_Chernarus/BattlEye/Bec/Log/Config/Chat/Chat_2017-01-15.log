18:15:35 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: no change? 
18:15:36 : Group: bobaliny2: Actually straight north
18:15:41 : Side: BowDownYaBish: ?
18:16:07 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: just flying in a mozzie and you shoot me from your cchopper GG 
18:16:24 : Side: BowDownYaBish: You followed us, we were going to leave you
18:16:26 : Side: Lunatick : oooh you mad 
18:16:45 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: no i am not mad,.. 
18:16:49 : Side: M.K.: so can you manage groups from the radio aswell?
18:17:01 : Side: LWB [SD]: no, just press f5
18:17:04 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: its funny that you just shoot randomely
18:17:07 : Side: M.K.: kk
18:17:22 : Side: Lunatick : well it wasnt random it was at you 
18:17:44 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: yea true crazy bandits
18:17:56 : Group: bobaliny2: near me
18:18:52 : Group: bobaliny2: they are headed back towards stary
18:21:37 : Group: bobaliny2: Where are tehy?
18:22:46 : Group: bobaliny2: nice
18:23:25 : Group: Fontes: dam 
18:23:28 : Group: bobaliny2: where are they?
18:23:39 : Side: Lunatick : lwb have you though about putting vehicles that are in range of a plot pole not to be blown up 
18:23:44 : Group: bobaliny2: I'll loop around
18:23:56 : Group: Fontes: only saw 2
18:23:57 : Group: bobaliny2: keep them distracted
18:24:04 : Group: bobaliny2: there's a third
18:24:07 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yes and we don't want to do that because we will end up with too many vehicles & the server will get laggy
18:24:10 : Side: LWB [SD]: Been there on last server. Ended up with 30+ vehicles at one base that couldnt be destroyed
18:24:29 : Side: BowDownYaBish: You should add the garage system
18:24:41 : Side: Lunatick : agreed 
18:25:05 : Side: LWB [SD]: nah, defeats the purpose in my opinon. Where is the danger? Dayz is about danger
18:25:13 : Side: LWB [SD]: or should be
18:25:16 : Group: bobaliny2: don't see anybody
18:25:17 : Side: M.K.: totaly agree
18:25:47 : Side: BowDownYaBish: You would still lose vehicles but it would stop people blowing shit up when the owners aren;t online
18:26:03 : Side: Lunatick : yh but when people just go up to your base and destroy all of your vehicles that you worked on getting
18:26:04 : Side: bobaliny2: My response to that is protect shit better
18:26:05 : Side: bobaliny2: or hide it
18:26:10 : Side: svvay: ^this
18:26:13 : Side: LWB [SD]: you cant loose vehciles that are stored in a database though
18:26:42 : Side: Lunatick : bobaliny has your base been kimied yet 
18:26:51 : Side: 2DIE4:  u can loose them using them  = ) 
18:26:52 : Side: Lunatick : kamied 
18:26:52 : Side: bobaliny2: haven't built one yet
18:27:05 : Side: BowDownYaBish: When you take them out of the garage you can be shot and lose it and also when you're going around the map in the vehicles
18:27:08 : Side: bobaliny2: But i've played long enough to know it can be countered
18:27:22 : Side: svvay: Bad idea BowDown, makes the game lose it's value
18:27:25 : Side: Lunatick : well then you cant hide stuff if all is needed is to ram the base and all vehicles in side will blow up 
18:27:36 : Side: bobaliny2: Don't leave you vehicles in your base then
18:27:44 : Side: bobaliny2: Have a secondary spot
18:27:49 : Side: 2DIE4:  base makes NO sense then
18:27:53 : Side: bobaliny2: Sure it does
18:27:57 : Side: bobaliny2: Keep your items there
18:27:58 : Side: Lunatick : what the fucking point of having  a base then 
18:27:59 : Side: 2DIE4:  not at all
18:28:01 : Side: bobaliny2: Keep teh easily blown up things away
18:28:11 : Side: bobaliny2: Y'all are just shitty that you aren't problem solvers
18:28:13 : Side: 2DIE4:  u full of it  dude
18:28:18 : Side: LWB [SD]: Its an issue that will never be agreed on as everyone thinks and plays different
18:28:19 : Side: svvay: Sounds like 2die4 has encountered this before
18:28:23 : Side: Sierra [SD]: If this is going to decend into an argument I suggest you all take this elsewhere.
18:28:29 : Group: Fontes: campers
18:28:31 : Group: Fontes: :D
18:28:42 : Side: M.K.: ^^
18:28:53 : Side: 2DIE4:  how much is a cessna?
18:29:11 : Side: LWB [SD]: So we have the set up we have and thats the way it is. Ive increased the base items slightly to allow for more protection
18:29:15 : Group: Fontes: someone at mew
18:29:18 : Side: Lunatick : all it was we shouted out an option and the whole server shut us down thats all 
18:29:32 : Side: svvay: lel
18:30:23 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Cessna's are 6 x 10oz gold to buy.
18:30:50 : Side: Lunatick : me and bow were on the last server that lwb had and it was better with the no kami rule 
18:31:20 : Side: LWB [SD]: But it caused us a hell of a lot of trouble enforcing it
18:31:43 : Side: Lunatick : so becasue you couldnt enforce a rule you toook it out 
18:31:45 : Side: LWB [SD]: we have better things to do than check logs constantly to see if someone did or didnt have something they say they did
18:31:58 : Side: LWB [SD]: if people were honest it wouldnt be an issue
18:32:00 : Side: LWB [SD]: but they arent
18:32:27 : Side: BowDownYaBish: You should just say that you NEED evidence to ban someone, if someone has no proof then nothing can be done, makes your job easier
18:32:29 : Side: Lunatick : its not that i mean if the person that got kamid had proof it would be a bannable offense 
18:32:47 : Group: Fontes: guys
18:33:00 : Group: Fontes: can you get some gear for me from their bodies 
18:33:09 : Side: LWB [SD]: But sometimes people loose conenction and the plane/heli crashes and it was accidental. It ends up he said/she said
18:33:23 : Side: Lunatick : oki what ever 
18:33:24 : Group: Fontes: i need to go lads
18:33:40 : Group: Fontes: cya guys 
18:33:42 : Side: 2DIE4:  its all good  .. well be the bandits yall dont want  =)
18:33:47 : Side: BowDownYaBish: That's when you should ask them for proof of them losing connection, if they can't provide it then they stay banned
18:34:27 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Food for thought maybe, idk, just think about it abit
18:35:16 : Group: matsa: You have to wait 130s
18:37:03 : Group: Joshuaa: yo
18:37:57 : Group: Joshuaa: whats happening

18:41:28 : Side: LWB [SD]: Nope

18:42:26 : Side: Christmas: sure its just military spawns and air fields 
18:42:27 : Side: Lunatick : ok dw
