11:06:16 : Side: 2DIE4:  Sierra---
11:06:41 : Side: 2DIE4:  would u pls check if someone glitched into our base ... like all the gold is gone  OUT OF THE SAFE
11:08:35 : Side: Turmoil: can they glitch into the safes as well? 
11:08:38 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I can only see if glitched if there is a video of it or something - they can't glitch into a safe though for sure.
11:08:46 : Side: Sierra [SD]: No - you cant glitch into safes.
11:09:02 : Side: 2DIE4:  but u can check who accessed the safe right
11:09:16 : Side: Sierra [SD]: No I can't check anything like that.
11:09:35 : Side: 2DIE4:  all gold and gems gone eccept the ones i put in there now
11:09:57 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Not even sure if LWB can - it might show up in the logs possibly. 
11:10:23 : Side: Turmoil: when are you dropping by for a cup of coffee sierra? xD
11:11:09 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Will ask him if he can look later. What time did you first notice the problem?

12:16:23 : Direct: Turmoil: gotta make sure i lock everything and dont carry to much stuff on me, if he lands and starts shooting
12:16:32 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah
12:16:37 : Direct: Turmoil: hopefully he stays far away :D
12:17:11 : Direct: Turmoil: gonna have to add some crates and gun racks after a bit as well ^^
12:17:14 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: its all set up very nicely :)
12:17:32 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah, im gonna remove these big doors tho
12:17:34 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: like the wooden bit
12:17:43 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: ah okies
12:17:48 : Direct: Turmoil: gonna build a seperate garage on the side of the building and make wood floors all over in here
12:18:02 : Direct: Turmoil: maybe a door here into the garage
12:18:06 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah that sounds like a cool idea
12:18:44 : Direct: Turmoil: Jesse has a cool plan, hes gonna build a boat base in the dam ^^
12:18:54 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: that would be fun too! :D
12:19:05 : Direct: Turmoil: he was working on the plans last night
12:19:49 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: I think maybe you guys should not make them too massive though because alot of big bases all in one area might cause you some lag maybe...
12:19:58 : Direct: Turmoil: we got a good team up here now, Prismic up on the hill, my old group at the dam, Koffiepot up the road and me here 
12:20:10 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yes :D its like a little village :D
12:20:15 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah i told Jesse about that becouse his base plans were quite huge xD
12:20:20 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: hee hee :D
12:20:25 : Direct: Turmoil: he desided to downscale a bit
12:20:53 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: xD 
12:21:07 : Direct: Turmoil: can i play solo multiplayer?
12:21:23 : Direct: Turmoil: like make my own map and play on it and build stuff sorta like a tryout before i build em on the server
12:21:46 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: very all very cool plans :D - no - if you want to do that you would have to get yourself a little test server & set it up
12:21:48 : Direct: Turmoil: guess thats called playing on LAN
12:21:57 : Direct: Turmoil: oh okay
12:22:18 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: it wouldnt save on the database I believe
12:22:36 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: not even sure you would be able to get into the server full stop like that
12:22:47 : Direct: Turmoil: well i guess ill try fail and succeed on this server then ^^
12:22:56 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: hee hee :D
12:23:09 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: I've got to go afk for a bit again
12:23:24 : Direct: Turmoil: well ill get on with crafting then :)
12:23:30 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: I will catch up with you later - have fun! :)

17:54:59 : Side: Cristi: Who's NW? 
17:55:07 : Direct: LWB [SD]: Kinda, 2die4 lost loads of stuff from locked safes
17:55:11 : Side: Turmoil: hey Sierra ^^
17:55:20 : Side: Sierra [SD]: hi xD
17:55:22 : Direct: LWB [SD]: and those two took it somehow
17:55:38 : Direct: LWB [SD]: and they had TWS weapons in thier safes
17:55:39 : Direct: Turmoil: ah nooo... thats not him, im pretty sure, i played with him last night and he logged out before me and same this morning
17:55:59 : Direct: LWB [SD]: they had a ton of keys and 2 of the vehicles were in koffie's base
17:56:14 : Direct: Turmoil: so i doubt that is him, he only blows stuff up if people attacks him
17:56:20 : Direct: LWB [SD]: and koffie sold a load of rubys around the same time all of 2die4's were stolen
17:56:26 : Direct: LWB [SD]: I think it was just coincidence
17:56:39 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: No offence to you fine gentlemen but this many young men on the server in one go drives me up the wall hee hee :P
17:56:43 : Direct: Turmoil: hmmm, well i can ask him if he had anyhting to do with it... hes mostly quite open when he does anything
17:56:55 : Group: Joshuaa: ok, you got a safe anywhere?
17:57:00 : Direct: LWB [SD]: I dont want to freak him out
17:57:06 : Group: bobaliny2: NAH

17:57:19 : Group: Joshuaa: you got gold anywhere?
17:57:35 : Group: bobaliny2: Spent it all on this XD
17:57:39 : Direct: Turmoil: he usually brags a bit sometimes when he gets good stuff or manage to hotwire someones planes so.. i would imagine if he raided 2DIE4 he would have 
17:57:41 : Direct: Turmoil: said something
17:57:44 : Group: Joshuaa: oh ok
17:58:03 : Direct: LWB [SD]: yeah probably. His afes were opened with codes which was the weird thing
17:58:27 : Direct: Turmoil: hmmm, what about his friends? 
17:58:31 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: :(
17:58:37 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: no wiggling

17:59:05 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: catching a bit of evening sun :D
17:59:05 : Direct: LWB [SD]: I thought that, but I dont know. 2dir4 says they wouldnt do that. and these two others looked dodgy

20:05:36 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I will back you up on this one Hail - it was probably a panic reaction because he had just been tp'd from the event.
20:05:53 : Side: Hailstorm: ^^
20:06:03 : Side: Hailstorm: 20 meters next to them ^^
20:06:24 : Side: Cristi: Wtf. You were teleported there?

20:09:41 : Side: Cristi: We can just relocate somewhere where you won't find us.

20:10:17 : Side: Hailstorm: WINANS
20:11:17 : Side: Cristi: Well it's obvious that even though we'd truce with you your friend would always look for revenge.
20:11:20 : Group: MeGa_Koffiepot: THX M8 
20:11:30 : Side: Cristi: So.. I hope that 1 bc was worth it :( 
20:11:34 : Side: Hailstorm: :/
20:12:23 : Side: Cristi: Honestly I'd be ok with you just returning what you took and we can part ways. But my friends really weren't into getting executed like that
