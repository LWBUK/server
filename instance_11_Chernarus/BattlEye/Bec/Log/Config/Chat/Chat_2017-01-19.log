19:29:51 : Group: Turmoil: yeah i seen it
19:30:13 : Group: Turmoil: exactly... if it doesnt belong to us... someone else has taken over, which isnt good
19:30:34 : Group: Turmoil: you need a toolbox and crowbar to take it away
19:30:42 : Group: Turmoil: i only have crowbar
19:31:12 : Group: Turmoil: we could do that, but still need to take that thing out of the ground, or else we cant use it
19:31:22 : Group: Turmoil: remove it at replace it, but it should be somewere safe
19:31:52 : Group: Turmoil: i dont want the russians or some other shitty guys to make a sniper base up here :P
19:32:09 : Group: Turmoil: double doors
19:32:19 : Group: Turmoil: guess the new owner placed one as well
19:32:47 : Group: Turmoil: whoever places a plotpole and takes ownership owns everything here
19:33:12 : Group: Turmoil: place plot pole - manage plot - take ownership - voila you own everything within 30m 
19:33:22 : Group: Turmoil: you also take ownership of the doors and locks then
19:33:54 : Group: Turmoil: should make sure to have supplies for a roof before placing plotpole again tho, or else whoever can fly in and take it
