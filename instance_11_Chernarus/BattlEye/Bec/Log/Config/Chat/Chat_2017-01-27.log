00:00:11 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: yea true.. but thats why we got a community so we protect each other
00:00:29 : Group: Paul: The downside is that I kind of hit a ceiling
00:00:39 : Group: Paul: I can't really store fancy cars and stuff
00:00:48 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: yes you can.,.. 
00:00:54 : Group: Paul: I could buy a heli, but I don't because I couldn't store it.
00:00:56 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: you need to build smart
00:01:00 : Group: Paul: How can I ?
00:01:10 : Group: Paul: I mean without building
00:01:39 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: just build a smart base and keep the ppl around happy ^^ 
00:01:55 : Group: Paul: so they would pay the rent ?
00:02:04 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: and if you earn alot of money in 1 day you can pop on every 7 dayz to amitain
00:02:33 : Group: Paul: yes, but if I want to play an other game, it will annoy me to have to go back to dayz
00:02:47 : Group: Paul: But the safe is a great idea
00:02:58 : Group: Paul: I'll do that to store my cash
00:02:58 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: ^^
00:03:08 : Group: Turmoil: only negative thing about the safe is that it resets after 7 days.... the code will be 0000
00:03:13 : Group: Turmoil: so make sure you hide it well
00:03:15 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: we dont care anny more about cash
00:03:25 : Group: Paul: really ?
00:03:35 : Group: Paul: well, that's nice
00:04:32 : Group: Paul: how much do you have in total ?
00:05:15 : Group: Turmoil: need to find a wheelw
00:05:24 : Group: Paul: If you want I can fly to stary and buy one
00:05:54 : Group: Paul: Let's see who brings a tire first :D
00:06:52 : Group: Paul: I go buy a tire at starya
00:07:18 : Group: Paul: tell me if you find one before
00:08:23 : Group: Paul: is there a way to know a player's humanity without asking ?
00:08:34 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: skin
00:08:36 : Group: Turmoil: not really
00:08:44 : Group: Paul: yes, but if he changes it ?
00:08:47 : Group: Paul: ok
00:08:49 : Group: Paul: thanks :)
00:08:53 : Group: Turmoil: if they are fresh spawn they have bandit outfit... but they can change it
00:08:54 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: in trade is the name red he is bandit and blue hero
00:10:03 : Group: Paul: I buy the tire
00:10:31 : Group: Turmoil: nice
00:13:46 : Group: Paul: spotted a car also
00:13:52 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: good
00:14:55 : Group: Paul: this kind of fancy landing is the reason I die so much
00:14:55 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: do you have wipes?
00:14:59 : Group: Paul: yes
00:15:11 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: tur needs it
00:16:04 : Group: Paul: got it ?
00:16:12 : Group: Turmoil: yes thank you ^^
00:16:40 : Group: Paul: I feel usefull ><
00:16:45 : Group: Turmoil: D
00:16:48 : Group: Turmoil: :D
00:17:06 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: your are hero
00:17:39 : Group: Paul: as I don't have a base, I have to drastically use the backpack
00:17:45 : Group: Paul: so always 3 wipes
00:17:49 : Group: Paul: and 4 bandages
00:17:55 : Group: Paul: 1 antibiotic
00:18:10 : Group: Paul: 1 epi pen
00:18:14 : Group: Paul: 1 morphine
00:18:20 : Group: Paul: and nothing more
00:19:27 : Group: Paul: shit, I just realized that when I packed the mozzie, I only had 2 slots
00:19:41 : Group: Paul: I lost the tank ><
00:19:49 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: take iuts in the car
00:19:51 : Group: Turmoil: i have one
00:20:00 : Group: Paul: you may need it
00:20:06 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: take it
00:20:10 : Group: Paul: ok, thanks
00:20:24 : Group: Paul: let's say it's for the wheel :)
00:21:31 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: you take what you need from the car
00:21:41 : Group: Paul: oh wait, I give you back the tank, mine just reappeared when I cleared inventory
00:26:10 : Group: Paul: whose base is that ?
00:26:17 : Group: Turmoil: the guys who got banned
00:26:36 : Side: SooqaBlyat: oh my god
00:26:37 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: shoot that door
00:26:42 : Side: SooqaBlyat: this sound...
00:26:48 : Side: SooqaBlyat: what is this?
00:27:12 : Group: Paul: I could climb with the mozzie
00:27:22 : Group: Paul: plant a bomb or something
00:27:37 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: do you have a bomb? :P 
00:27:40 : Group: Paul: no
00:27:44 : Group: Paul: not yet ;)
00:28:21 : Side: Fedequeso: what is " vehicle pound " ?
00:28:27 : Group: Paul: I know !
00:28:33 : Side: Paul: I know !
00:28:39 : Side: Paul: I asked it 3 hours ago
00:28:56 : Side: Fedequeso: is a kind of mission ?
00:29:01 : Side: Paul: When you leave a vehicle in a safe zone when the server restarts, it teleports there
00:29:10 : Side: Fedequeso: oooh nice
00:29:15 : Side: Paul: So you can get it back
00:29:29 : Side: Fedequeso: lock it or unlockit ?
00:30:07 : Side: Paul: wether the car is locked or not, it will get teleported
00:30:26 : Side: Paul: But I believe the lock will be the same that when you left it
00:30:38 : Side: Fedequeso: i mean when the car is teleported gets unlockit ?
00:30:41 : Side: Fedequeso: ah ok
00:30:45 : Side: Fedequeso: thanks c:
00:30:48 : Group: Paul: I'm stuck
00:30:52 : Side: Turmoil: all vehicles moved to the vehicle pound will be unlocked and free for anyone to steal
00:30:55 : Group: Paul: Can't open the context menu
00:31:07 : Side: Paul: sorry, I was wrong
00:33:16 : Group: Paul: I have a sledgehammer, could it have been usefull against the door from a moment ago ?
00:33:43 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: ofc but its agesses
00:33:49 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: take agess
00:34:34 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: a door needs more than 2500 m2 rounds.. 
00:36:04 : Group: Paul: I'm stuck
00:36:10 : Group: Paul: I'll log out and come back

19:00:25 : Group: LWB [SD]: now?
19:00:51 : Group: Joshuaa: yo, i was just wondering why mine and fontes' safes were removed just because we shared a base with matsa and the others?
19:01:37 : Group: LWB [SD]: We had reports from more than one player, and we suspected that they were either duping or spawning stuff, soI had to delete all thier safes Im afraid
19:02:06 : Group: LWB [SD]: That might have included yours too. I will give you some stuff, and if you find a new place for a base, Ill give you a building box
19:02:28 : Group: Joshuaa: yeah it included all of ours, we had a load of gear man haha
19:02:45 : Group: LWB [SD]: I know, sorry, but I couldnt tell what was what, so it all had to go
19:02:59 : Group: LWB [SD]: You can start fresh, but Ill give you a helping hand
19:03:05 : Group: Joshuaa: but im 100% positive they werent duping or spawning things in dude
19:03:20 : Group: Fontes: they are good guys man
19:03:39 : Group: LWB [SD]: well two separte players mentioned it, so its a bit suspicious, and they were 100 percent glitching
19:04:13 : Group: Joshuaa: could it not be that these two players have been killed by them and felt a bit butt hurt maybe?
19:04:35 : Group: LWB [SD]: I dont believe so, with one, possibly. The other I trust pretty much
19:05:04 : Group: Joshuaa: hmm ok, thanks for your time
19:05:57 : Group: LWB [SD]: Ill give you some briefs when you get to a safer spot
