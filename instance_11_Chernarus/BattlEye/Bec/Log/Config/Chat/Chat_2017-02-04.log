12:57:41 : Side: -SDS- Gowther: Ich hab letztens schon mit Turmoil darüber geredet... Hab da einiges erfahren
12:57:57 : Side: -SDS- Gowther: Wir haben den plotpole einer basis jetzt uns selbst überschrieben
12:58:24 : Side: -SDS- Gowther: Wie können wir das baumaterial jetzt abbauen? es war alles beschädigt und haben es dann repariert
12:58:25 : Side: 2DIE4:  gut
12:58:45 : Side: -SDS- Gowther: Aber wenn ich es abbauen will steht da dass es keinen ersatz gibt
12:58:51 : Side: 2DIE4:  richtig
12:58:56 : Side: 2DIE4:  english pls
12:59:17 : Side: -SDS- Gowther: My english is not so the yellow from the egg XD
12:59:25 : Side: 2DIE4:   if u take over plotpole ownership   means u  have take over the base   to the last brick
12:59:36 : Side: 2DIE4:  but m,odular building items do not refund
12:59:43 : Side: -SDS- Gowther: Are u teamspeak of the server?
12:59:58 : Side: 2DIE4:  brickwalls dont refund   metal floors dont refund
13:00:06 : Side: -SDS- Gowther: oh okee
13:00:09 : Side: -SDS- Gowther: thats sad
