09:01:51 : Side: |Laura|: hi
09:02:48 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Sorry Laura was in the kitchen - bases start to break down and dissapear if you don't maintain them every 7 days. Hi Mixer
09:03:08 : Side: |Laura|: does the gear stay?
09:03:34 : Side: mixer_90: hi
09:03:44 : Side: |Laura|: like the safes :)
09:03:46 : Side: Sierra [SD]: If you mean gear in safes - safes don't dissapear, they unlock after 7 days.

09:04:15 : Side: Sierra [SD]: :)
09:05:28 : Side: |Laura|: my firends joined this server last night, as there was a big problem on another server we just started going on, admin abuse etc,
09:05:39 : Side: |Laura|: soi got left a offliner thjis is the server they have come to :)
09:07:12 : Side: mixer_90: Do you know who is admin this server?! I want ask Thenks for him))\
09:07:32 : Side: |Laura|: sierra is admin and the other person is at work
09:07:54 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Ah right - we don't really play on here as such - I do missions when there isnt any or many people online though. We tend to admin only and keep out 
09:07:59 : Side: Sierra [SD]: of people's way :)
09:08:20 : Side: mixer_90: Wow, so sierra - Thanks you!
09:08:22 : Side: |Laura|: yeh thats fair enough :)
09:09:22 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Oh :) - you are welcome - we are happy to provide & help 
09:10:18 : Side: mixer_90: Becaous im russian, and i didn\t play in to russian servers. All russerver - its only stupid school-boys and cheaters)
09:10:35 : Side: |Laura|: im from uk
09:10:38 : Side: mixer_90: And they dont have uptimization)
09:11:05 : Side: mixer_90: UK - it is United Kingdom?!
09:11:11 : Side: |Laura|: yes
09:11:27 : Side: mixer_90: Cool!
09:11:29 : Side: mixer_90: )
09:11:51 : Side: mixer_90: I thinks you are friendly )))
09:12:04 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah I see - we have quite alot of anti duping/hacking settings in place on here so it's pretty hard for someone to cheat on here. :)
09:12:32 : Side: |Laura|: i am a bandit, but i am friendly if people need help with missions, and after i done a mission, i do leave loot etv for others
09:13:02 : Side: |Laura|: so i guess im bit of both, depending on my mood :p
09:13:20 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I think most people on here are friendly. Even the bandits are friendly and helpful to talk to :) - I guess you fall into that catagory Laura :)
09:13:34 : Side: |Laura|: yeh :)
09:13:35 : Side: mixer_90: )))
09:15:39 : Side: mixer_90: Sierra, if you will be do a modding scripts for you server, I can help you for translaiting from russian)
09:16:05 : Side: mixer_90: My English is bad, but Rus - is good)
09:17:37 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Thank you Mixer that is very nice of you to offer. LWB does the coding/scripting etc. I will tell him :)
09:17:56 : Side: |Laura|: how long u guys had this server for 
09:19:28 : Side: Sierra [SD]: this particular one since beginning of december I believe. I can't remember the exact date. Overall we have been going for just over a year.

09:20:18 : Side: mixer_90: )

09:22:02 : Side: |Laura|: nice number
09:22:10 : Side: Sierra [SD]: it was 15-20 in the day 30-40 evening but then we added the anti duping lol
09:22:24 : Side: Sierra [SD]: so you can tell how many people like to dupe!
09:22:35 : Side: |Laura|: yeh.. alot will go when u add that but thats cos they r cheating buggers :)
09:22:49 : Side: |Laura|: yeh 10/15 nice number tho... makes it enjoyable
09:23:22 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Yes we prefer it quieter too - you don't get so many problems and arguments. Its just a nice group of people on here now.
09:24:14 : Side: |Laura|: yeh :)
10:26:55 : Side: |Laura|: how far away from tradezones can u build?
10:27:42 : Side: Sierra [SD]: 500m - when you go to place your plot it will come up with a message if you are too close to traders/military etc
