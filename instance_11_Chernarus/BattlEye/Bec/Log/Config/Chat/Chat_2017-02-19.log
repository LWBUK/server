19:17:26 : Side: Hailstorm: yes, but if a new guy get killed by an armed ah6 he will ragequit
19:17:50 : Side: 2DIE4:  well then he needs to play with barbi dolls
19:18:25 : Side: Peasant: but as a newcomer to a server you have to expect others to be more geared up than you
19:18:42 : Side: 2DIE4: my point 
19:18:43 : Side: Peasant: just keep cracking on until you can fight at the same level
19:19:05 : Side: 2DIE4:  u cant just come in my house and open the fridge takin out beer expectn g me not to slap u
