10:51:24 : Side: Turmoil: always open all safes whit 5 day interwalls to be sure i dont exceed the 7 day
10:51:38 : Side: 2DIE4:  u should get in contact with LWB    to figure it out
10:52:10 : Side: Turmoil: im not too worried about it :) i got money so, but others might just not be so happy about it, lol
10:52:10 : Side: 2DIE4: its not only open them ...!!!!!  be aware!   u have to change the content as well  one item at least!
10:52:26 : Side: Turmoil: well that might be it then
10:52:42 : Side: 2DIE4:  learnd som new   =)
