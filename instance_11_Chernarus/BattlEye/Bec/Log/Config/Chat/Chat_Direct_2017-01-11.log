18:58:48 : Direct: Turmoil: ah thats okay, figured you were eating or something ^^
18:59:07 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: oh cool :) - sounds like a plan - lots at the vehicle pound lol

18:59:21 : Direct: Turmoil: i want one that has keys ^^
18:59:38 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah - is a bit more secure
18:59:54 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: work going ok so far this week?
18:59:55 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah... its fairly safe here... but when i go out looting its good to be able to lock it
19:00:17 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah :D 
19:00:21 : Direct: Turmoil: not really, unfortunatly =/ worked half day monday, thuesday and today was full days... my hand swelled to twice it size so im going
19:00:27 : Direct: Turmoil: to the doc tomorrow to check it out
19:00:29 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: oh no!
19:00:35 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: that isnt a good start
19:01:08 : Direct: Turmoil: not at all, my two first cars came back from the paintshop today, some of the other guys had to strip of the paint and bondo and redo it becouse it 
19:01:15 : Direct: Turmoil: was bad 
19:01:49 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: hmm - maybe your hand is telling you, you aren't quite ready to go back to work.
19:02:20 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah, i talked with the doctors office today and they might send me on a training thingy, not sure what its called in english
19:02:47 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: ah right maybe like physio?
19:02:58 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah! :)
19:03:15 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: Well I hope you manage to get it sorted. It must be very painful
19:03:25 : Direct: Turmoil: got an appointment with the doctors office tomorrow at 11 so i guess i'll find out what the next step will be
19:03:47 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah - hope it goes ok and you manage to sort something out.
19:03:49 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah me 2... got a bit depressed yesterday, was really looking forward to get back to work, social life and stuff
19:04:10 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah I know what you mean, you were all ready and now this is a setback
19:04:20 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah
19:04:34 : Direct: Turmoil: well, i guess its just a part of life... not gonna whine about it ^^
19:04:48 : Direct: Turmoil: shit happens, lol
19:05:07 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yep - best attitude to have isnt it - got to get on with things. 
19:05:24 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah, wonder what im gonna do tho if i get another month sickleave
19:05:41 : Direct: Turmoil: dont really have much special stuff to do, especially if i cant use the hand for more heavy stuff
19:06:06 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: Yeah - you will be getting frustrated
19:06:23 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: you must already be lol
19:06:24 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah, well thats nothing new xD lol

19:06:46 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: see how you were doing
19:06:59 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: oh really - any particular reason?
19:07:01 : Direct: Turmoil: bought a truck at Klen and was gonna airlift it here and some buggers stole it
19:07:22 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah that is annoying when that happens
19:07:42 : Direct: Turmoil: should make towing available when veichles are locked if you have the key in your backpack ^^ lol
19:08:06 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: this is the type of game that can get like that though. Lol yeah - I'm not sure if that is even possible! would make things safer though!
19:08:29 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah, today my plan is to make my way to the trader by foot xD 
19:08:48 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: I always think at least in wow if you get killed you dont loose your gear! - oh it isnt too bad to klen is it - especially if you have a bike
19:09:13 : Direct: Turmoil: i got 4 suitcases... was hoping that would be enough for an armed one at the hero ^^
19:09:20 : Direct: Turmoil: either SUV or Humwee
19:09:36 : Direct: Turmoil: want something with a bit more armor
19:09:40 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: ah ok - it most probably is - I haven't checked recently though - want me to take a quick look?
