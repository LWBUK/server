21:27:28 : Direct: Stiefelriemen Bill: the only open door was this one here at me
21:28:01 : Direct: LWB [SD]: I would suggest you block the floor off as you can probably get in that way

23:47:45 : Direct: Turmoil: you were in the plane? :O
23:47:46 : Direct: Colin: want to buy a heli
23:47:55 : Direct: Colin: i had an mv 22 too
23:48:16 : Direct: Turmoil: oh, your the guy who just landed before me? or did you hide in the one i just sold?
23:48:40 : Direct: Colin: i landed before you
23:48:54 : Direct: Turmoil: you also found one? xD 
23:48:58 : Direct: Colin: but dont know which heli i have to buy
23:49:08 : Direct: Turmoil: depends what you intend to use it for
23:49:34 : Direct: Colin: no, the russian maffia guys made the mission, my mates and me killed them and stole it XD
23:49:43 : Direct: Turmoil: haha awesome
23:49:48 : Direct: Turmoil: those guys are... anoying 
23:49:56 : Direct: Colin: they are so bad....
23:50:04 : Direct: ReaperZA: 9292 is safe combi
23:50:08 : Direct: Colin: look, again one guy dead
23:50:25 : Direct: Turmoil: if you want a good transportation heli you should get the Merlin
23:50:40 : Direct: Colin: over 300 meter you are safe, they acnt hit you ovewr this distance ^^
23:50:48 : Direct: Turmoil: it has very good fuel, good room, it stores 15 guns, 200 items and 10 backpacks i think it was
23:51:02 : Direct: Turmoil: also you can airlift cars and other stuff with it
23:51:05 : Direct: Colin: hmmm, yes, but i need the money for basebuilding
23:51:23 : Direct: Turmoil: also you could go for the UH heli, same price but less armor fuel and storage
23:51:30 : Direct: Colin: atm you can glitch into it and we have to fix tis
23:52:11 : Direct: Turmoil: you can buy the 1man little bird, only 60oz 
23:52:16 : Direct: Colin: need something fast to save the money
23:52:32 : Direct: Turmoil: i mostly use the mozzie becouse its cheap and i can afford to loose it if i get killed
23:52:58 : Direct: Colin: yes, think i will buy one of that
23:53:07 : Direct: Turmoil: and you can build it yourself from your toolbox if you have the tree main parts of it
23:53:23 : Direct: Colin: need one more fuetank
23:53:50 : Direct: Colin: you have one more fueltank for me?
23:54:03 : Direct: Turmoil: sorry, only have one for my own mozzie, but a mozzie is cheap 
23:54:17 : Direct: Colin: hmmm, k, thx
23:54:19 : Direct: Turmoil: just buy one, you got 3 briefs if you sold that plane ^^
