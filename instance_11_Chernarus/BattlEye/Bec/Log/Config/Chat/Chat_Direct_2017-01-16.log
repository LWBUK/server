11:53:48 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: perhaps later
11:53:57 : Direct: Turmoil: i bought supplies and there is a mission at base :(
11:54:23 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: ah damn
11:54:34 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: heros too
11:54:35 : Direct: Turmoil: black one as well... probably gonna wreck my heli going back down there xD
11:55:16 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: xD prob not good to attempt right now
11:55:41 : Direct: Turmoil: decided to move out of the dam yesterday... finally got all the stuff i needed to get started
11:55:50 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: that is pretty cool :D
11:56:17 : Direct: Turmoil: fuelpump, safes, building supplies, money, pretty much everything :D 
11:56:35 : Direct: Turmoil: money goes quite fast tho when you build bases
11:56:58 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: xD so you are all set up. Yes it does the parts are quite expensive if you dont find them all at misisons
11:57:22 : Direct: Turmoil: i saved up alot of money the past weeks
11:58:06 : Direct: Turmoil: sold at least 3 MH22's or whatever theyr called, also looted a safe with 7 briefs, looting as well, had over 20 briefs + the topaz :D 
11:59:26 : Direct: Turmoil: im gonna head down back to base, see if i can land without getting shot ^^
11:59:34 : Direct: Turmoil: your welcome to come down for a look if you want
12:05:30 : Direct: Turmoil: Koffie!!!
12:05:36 : Direct: Turmoil: i put the doorway in your safe :)
12:06:35 : Direct: Turmoil: forgot to put in the MRE
12:15:00 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: looks good
12:15:08 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: nice and compact
12:15:15 : Direct: Turmoil: still needs some work ^^
12:15:52 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: view is good isnt it
12:15:55 : Direct: Turmoil: that heli is worrying me...
12:16:00 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah it is :)
12:16:20 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: its gone far away atm i think
12:16:23 : Direct: Turmoil: gotta make sure i lock everything and dont carry to much stuff on me, if he lands and starts shooting
12:16:32 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah
12:16:37 : Direct: Turmoil: hopefully he stays far away :D
12:17:11 : Direct: Turmoil: gonna have to add some crates and gun racks after a bit as well ^^
12:17:15 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: its all set up very nicely :)
12:17:32 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah, im gonna remove these big doors tho
12:17:34 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: like the wooden bit
12:17:43 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: ah okies
12:17:48 : Direct: Turmoil: gonna build a seperate garage on the side of the building and make wood floors all over in here
12:18:02 : Direct: Turmoil: maybe a door here into the garage
12:18:06 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah that sounds like a cool idea
12:18:44 : Direct: Turmoil: Jesse has a cool plan, hes gonna build a boat base in the dam ^^
12:18:54 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: that would be fun too! :D
12:19:05 : Direct: Turmoil: he was working on the plans last night
12:19:49 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: I think maybe you guys should not make them too massive though because alot of big bases all in one area might cause you some lag maybe...
12:19:58 : Direct: Turmoil: we got a good team up here now, Prismic up on the hill, my old group at the dam, Koffiepot up the road and me here 
12:20:10 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yes :D its like a little village :D
12:20:15 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah i told Jesse about that becouse his base plans were quite huge xD
12:20:20 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: hee hee :D
12:20:25 : Direct: Turmoil: he desided to downscale a bit
12:20:53 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: xD 
12:21:07 : Direct: Turmoil: can i play solo multiplayer?
12:21:23 : Direct: Turmoil: like make my own map and play on it and build stuff sorta like a tryout before i build em on the server
12:21:46 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: very all very cool plans :D - no - if you want to do that you would have to get yourself a little test server & set it up
12:21:48 : Direct: Turmoil: guess thats called playing on LAN
12:21:57 : Direct: Turmoil: oh okay
12:22:18 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: it wouldnt save on the database I believe
12:22:36 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: not even sure you would be able to get into the server full stop like that
12:22:47 : Direct: Turmoil: well i guess ill try fail and succeed on this server then ^^
12:22:56 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: hee hee :D
12:23:09 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: I've got to go afk for a bit again
12:23:24 : Direct: Turmoil: well ill get on with crafting then :)
12:23:30 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: I will catch up with you later - have fun! :)

17:47:44 : Direct: Turmoil: he bailed
17:47:47 : Direct: LWB [SD]: well
17:48:08 : Direct: LWB [SD]: there goes a few briefs :D
17:48:18 : Direct: Turmoil: could have given em to me insted
17:48:33 : Direct: LWB [SD]: how well do you know that guy
17:48:34 : Direct: Turmoil: i crash enough in helis so i dont think im gonna try planes 
17:48:58 : Direct: Turmoil: hes been hanging around our TS for a while, dont really know him
17:49:02 : Direct: LWB [SD]: ok
17:49:21 : Direct: Turmoil: anyhting special on your mind?
17:50:16 : Direct: LWB [SD]: just something that I saw earlier in the logs, might be nothing
17:50:37 : Direct: Turmoil: alrighty... well i can keep an eye out if ya want
17:51:00 : Direct: LWB [SD]: did his base get raided recently, or loose keys to someone?
17:51:17 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah, he told me someone raided his base
17:51:21 : Direct: JamesDaGamer: sorry
17:51:30 : Direct: LWB [SD]: ok, thats probably what it was then
17:51:32 : Direct: Turmoil: lost some trucks i think, fuel truck
17:51:39 : Direct: Turmoil: and repair
17:51:59 : Direct: LWB [SD]: ok
17:52:28 : Direct: Turmoil: all i know, i can go digging see what i can find out if you suspect any faul play
17:52:45 : Direct: LWB [SD]: did he hang around with anyone else
17:53:08 : Direct: Turmoil: well he's been around this area with my group and also with sirlongsleeves and his guys
17:53:46 : Direct: LWB [SD]: Name zeus or Kleaticus mean anything to you?
17:54:02 : Direct: Turmoil: never heard about those, sorry
17:54:24 : Direct: LWB [SD]: ok, probaly nothing and he's just in the middle
17:54:37 : Direct: Turmoil: some bad shizzle going on? 
17:55:07 : Direct: LWB [SD]: Kinda, 2die4 lost loads of stuff from locked safes
17:55:22 : Direct: LWB [SD]: and those two took it somehow
17:55:38 : Direct: LWB [SD]: and they had TWS weapons in thier safes
17:55:39 : Direct: Turmoil: ah nooo... thats not him, im pretty sure, i played with him last night and he logged out before me and same this morning
17:55:59 : Direct: LWB [SD]: they had a ton of keys and 2 of the vehicles were in koffie's base
17:56:14 : Direct: Turmoil: so i doubt that is him, he only blows stuff up if people attacks him
17:56:20 : Direct: LWB [SD]: and koffie sold a load of rubys around the same time all of 2die4's were stolen
17:56:26 : Direct: LWB [SD]: I think it was just coincidence
17:56:39 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: No offence to you fine gentlemen but this many young men on the server in one go drives me up the wall hee hee :P
17:56:43 : Direct: Turmoil: hmmm, well i can ask him if he had anyhting to do with it... hes mostly quite open when he does anything
17:57:00 : Direct: LWB [SD]: I dont want to freak him out
17:57:10 : Direct: Turmoil: alright ^^ 
17:57:39 : Direct: Turmoil: he usually brags a bit sometimes when he gets good stuff or manage to hotwire someones planes so.. i would imagine if he raided 2DIE4 he would have 
17:57:41 : Direct: Turmoil: said something
17:58:03 : Direct: LWB [SD]: yeah probably. His afes were opened with codes which was the weird thing
17:58:27 : Direct: Turmoil: hmmm, what about his friends? 
17:58:31 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: :(
17:58:37 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: no wiggling
17:58:55 : Direct: Turmoil: so cosy with friends visiting 
17:59:05 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: catching a bit of evening sun :D
17:59:05 : Direct: LWB [SD]: I thought that, but I dont know. 2dir4 says they wouldnt do that. and these two others looked dodgy
17:59:16 : Direct: Turmoil: hey wait, did you just break into my base? im sure i locked the doors
17:59:22 : Direct: LWB [SD]: hacker
17:59:25 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: I flew
17:59:29 : Direct: Turmoil: xD
17:59:45 : Direct: Turmoil: well, if i hear anything ill let you know
17:59:53 : Direct: LWB [SD]: cool, thanks

18:01:20 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: oh ok well if you are going to do dinner.... :P
18:01:27 : Direct: Turmoil: hoho, would you rather make dinner than get wood?
18:01:39 : Direct: Turmoil: the forest kind of wood... so im not mistaken
18:01:48 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: No I'll get some wood

18:05:23 : Direct: Turmoil: oh you put god mode on now... why didnt you do that earlier?
18:05:37 : Direct: LWB [SD]: I thought it was lol
18:05:58 : Direct: Turmoil: i bet she did too when she told me to saw you
