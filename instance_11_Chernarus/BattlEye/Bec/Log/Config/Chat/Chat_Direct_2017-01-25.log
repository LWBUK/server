14:08:54 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: you guys need anything else?
14:09:19 : Direct: Turmoil: is there any way to move all items into safe insted of one and one item?
14:09:36 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: not that I am aware of

14:42:40 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: you got your toolbox?
14:42:55 : Direct: Turmoil: i removed it... but now i cant place it again, to many items apparently :(
14:42:59 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: oh
14:43:11 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yeah you will have to get rid of one prob then
14:43:12 : Direct: Turmoil: if you want you can help me delete the crates and gunracks here xD except the two racks on the right side 
14:43:29 : Direct: Turmoil: but your probably still at work
14:43:46 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: yup ok - no its ok - I am here so might as well, then I am going
14:43:51 : Direct: Turmoil: still gets to many items within 100m 
14:44:21 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: all these except the two by you
14:44:22 : Direct: Turmoil: thats weird, im not over the 200 limit yet i think
14:44:31 : Direct: Turmoil: except these two yeah
14:44:41 : Direct: Turmoil: two gun racks on right side has to stay, rest can go
14:44:47 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: ok no gear in?
14:44:59 : Direct: Turmoil: not any of value at least :)
14:46:13 : Direct: Turmoil: weeeeird, still says to many items within 100m :O im SURE im not over the limit now :(
14:46:48 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: hmm - I'm not sure - will tell LWB but he is indisposed atm
14:47:09 : Direct: Turmoil: alrighty... how long will the base stand without plot pole tho? anyone can remove stuff right?
14:47:50 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: It wont all of a sudden dissapear but I think people can get in etc
14:47:56 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah
14:48:27 : Direct: Turmoil: they can also remove walls etc... so i might be screwed now xD
14:49:21 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: have you tried relogging?
14:49:38 : Direct: Turmoil: i can try
14:49:48 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: well it does sometimes work
14:49:55 : Direct: Turmoil: zombies are glitching in now when i dont have the plot pole
14:50:05 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: ill wait here for you 
14:50:12 : Direct: Turmoil: aborting now
14:50:15 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: ok
14:50:23 : Direct: Turmoil: damn zombies
14:53:35 : Direct: Turmoil: same message
14:53:57 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: hmm I am not sure then
14:54:13 : Direct: Turmoil: ill remove some bag fences
14:54:33 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: ok - I've told LWB so as soon as he can he will come look
14:54:40 : Direct: Turmoil: nice :) 
14:55:12 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: I dont have any way of counting the amount of items or anything from here
14:55:35 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: its strange though because I wouldnt have thought you could build more than 200
14:55:39 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: that is the whole point
14:55:42 : Direct: Turmoil: ill get Jesse to try and place a plot pole
14:56:03 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: ok then - anyway I have got to log now - but I will catch up with you later

15:01:28 : Direct: Turmoil: 185 for me xD
15:01:32 : Direct: LWB [SD]: maybe it counts your safes
15:01:36 : Direct: LWB [SD]: for you but not me
15:01:53 : Direct: LWB [SD]: and doors maybe
15:02:02 : Direct: Turmoil: perhaos
15:02:14 : Direct: Turmoil: will these items still count in? boundry ends here
15:02:36 : Direct: LWB [SD]: not sure
15:02:45 : Direct: Turmoil: ill try and pick it up and replace it 
15:02:52 : Direct: Turmoil: so its mine again and not jesse
15:03:29 : Direct: Turmoil: can you remove it? ill get another one from my safe... you can just delete the pole i guess
