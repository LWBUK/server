15:28:08 : Direct: LWB [SD]: it easy to glitch in the walls
15:28:29 : Direct: LWB [SD]: nt of this specific building
15:28:32 : Direct: LWB [SD]: not
15:29:51 : Direct: Arne: bombed the bulding
15:36:24 : Direct: Arne: hi
15:36:42 : Direct: Arne: you here
15:36:56 : Direct: Arne: yes
15:37:03 : Direct: Arne: i dont feel like pressing the bottom again
15:37:08 : Direct: matsa: if i made you think i was glithing
15:37:18 : Direct: Arne: well how did you get in
15:37:19 : Direct: matsa: im not that kind of a person
15:37:41 : Direct: matsa: i already told admin
15:37:41 : Direct: Arne: dude you straight up kamikazeed me in traders. why would i think otherwise?
15:38:39 : Direct: Arne: well matsa. i am sorry too then.. 
15:39:17 : Direct: Arne: i just really wish you would tell me haha.
15:41:03 : Direct: matsa: i know a way to glitch in but i would never do it
15:42:13 : Direct: matsa: thats immoral and not allowed
15:42:22 : Direct: Arne: what is?
15:42:29 : Direct: matsa: glitching
15:42:47 : Direct: matsa: will never do it
15:43:00 : Direct: Arne: agreed.
15:44:39 : Direct: Arne: i told you
15:45:21 : Direct: Arne: with mk19 rounds tell it fell down
15:45:27 : Direct: Arne: till*
15:45:31 : Direct: Arne: yes
15:45:44 : Direct: Arne: it was quite fun. at the time i didnt know it was your base
15:45:53 : Direct: Arne: i just wanted GM
15:46:04 : Direct: Arne: it is for the big humvee. dont know what it is called
15:46:11 : Direct: Arne: the hero vehicle
15:46:55 : Direct: Arne: that is why i put up the back wall because it is not possible to get te plot witht hat approach anymore
15:47:18 : Direct: Arne: i can have no clue how to get the plot honestly
15:47:56 : Direct: Arne: so enjoy it. i dont really have any mates on this server, so there is no reason for me to build a base
15:48:28 : Direct: Arne: haha famous last words
15:49:09 : Direct: Arne: sure
15:59:05 : Direct: matsa: admin?
16:07:09 : Direct: LWB [SD]: let me do it
16:07:42 : Direct: Turmoil: does it matter who places it?
16:07:54 : Direct: Turmoil: i should in theory be able to remove it even tho i placed it myself?
16:07:55 : Direct: LWB [SD]: the person who places it should be able to remove it
16:08:02 : Direct: LWB [SD]: so I dont know why you cant
16:08:10 : Direct: Turmoil: yeah, i thought so too... i removed plotpoles elswhere so
16:08:18 : Direct: Turmoil: btw, i found one more koffiepot base today

16:10:49 : Direct: Turmoil: PI Turmoil always delivers xD
16:11:02 : Direct: LWB [SD]: he kept trying to get on yesterday, even used his headshot name
16:11:16 : Direct: Turmoil: oh, maybe he misses the server then, lol
16:11:23 : Direct: LWB [SD]: must do
16:11:31 : Direct: Turmoil: should have tought about that before the duped and then tried duping again 
16:11:42 : Direct: LWB [SD]: yep

19:38:11 : Direct: Paul: really, an heroic act
19:38:15 : Direct: Hailstorm: ^^
19:38:32 : Direct: Paul: but masta is a cunt
19:38:49 : Direct: Hailstorm: yes but it wasnt heroic to steal the silver blackhawk and destroy the merlin at my mates base -.-
19:38:51 : Direct: Paul: he assaulted me while I was on foot
19:39:00 : Direct: Paul: (masta)
19:39:03 : Direct: Paul: I'm new here

19:39:37 : Direct: Hailstorm: he died in an explosion and ask the admin for his gear
19:39:53 : Direct: Paul: I like how you are friendly
19:40:07 : Direct: Paul: would you shoot me if we happen to meet out of a safe zone ?
19:40:39 : Direct: Hailstorm: if i know its you i wont shoot, but most times i shot and ask after that
19:40:52 : Direct: Paul: well, I usually yell "friendly"
19:40:55 : Direct: Hailstorm: but if i shoot you i will let you your gear
19:41:05 : Direct: Paul: well, thanks, that's a start
19:41:29 : Direct: Hailstorm: i am bandit, but i prefere it to be a hero
19:41:48 : Direct: Paul: hey, I have a problem with my mozzie
19:42:03 : Direct: Paul: All parts are green but I can't pack it due to damage
19:42:09 : Direct: Paul: any idea ?

19:43:34 : Direct: Hailstorm: switch weapon and try

19:44:17 : Direct: Hailstorm: no you cant disable a mozzie you bought

19:45:34 : Direct: Hailstorm: its not full, but better than nothing for the start
19:45:39 : Direct: Arne: the guns?
19:45:44 : Direct: Paul: the thing is, the separate parts cost less than a repair ><
19:45:45 : Direct: Hailstorm: no, only a friendly gesture
