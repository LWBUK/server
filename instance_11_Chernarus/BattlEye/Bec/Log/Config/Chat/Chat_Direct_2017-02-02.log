22:50:42 : Direct: Turmoil: you could ^^ but you pretty much only need norwegian if you go to norway
22:50:54 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: its fun to learn new stuff
22:51:00 : Direct: Turmoil: spanish, french or dutch would probably be more usefull ^^
22:51:02 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: but can I actually say it lol :D

22:51:22 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: lol

22:51:54 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: waiting to see if freedom comes back on :D.
22:52:30 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: left him a little present
22:52:53 : Direct: Turmoil: lol
22:53:18 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: the mystery mozzie stealer mysteriously returned a mystery present :D
22:53:29 : Direct: Turmoil: haha yeah ^^
22:53:46 : Direct: Turmoil: im thinking about what i want to build... i just realized that the garage plans are pretty useless
22:53:51 : Direct: Turmoil: i have a garage xD
22:54:04 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: The movie I put on turned out to be in norwegian lol = xD you could build a whole new base...
22:54:25 : Direct: Turmoil: i guess i could ^^ but i dont really need it 
22:54:51 : Direct: Turmoil: i hear weird noises, but we are both sitting still
22:55:02 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: i dont have my headphones on
22:55:13 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: cant see anyone here though
22:55:26 : Direct: Turmoil: probably just paranoid after the discussion with winans and hailstorm
22:55:31 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: xD
22:55:52 : Direct: Turmoil: dont know were they got the idea that i teamed up with 2DIE4 to raid bases... i never raided bases with him xD  
22:55:58 : Direct: Turmoil: they are pissed at me for some reason
22:56:31 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: lol no idea - wouldn't worry about it - they are just sulking because bandits dont get a lav and they can't be arsed to play nicely and become a hero
22:56:48 : Direct: Turmoil: true 
22:56:56 : Direct: Sierra [SD]: big babies
