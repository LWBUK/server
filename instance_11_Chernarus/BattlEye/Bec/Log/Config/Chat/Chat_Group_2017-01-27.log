00:00:11 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: yea true.. but thats why we got a community so we protect each other
00:00:29 : Group: Paul: The downside is that I kind of hit a ceiling
00:00:39 : Group: Paul: I can't really store fancy cars and stuff
00:00:48 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: yes you can.,.. 
00:00:54 : Group: Paul: I could buy a heli, but I don't because I couldn't store it.
00:00:56 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: you need to build smart
00:01:00 : Group: Paul: How can I ?
00:01:10 : Group: Paul: I mean without building
00:01:39 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: just build a smart base and keep the ppl around happy ^^ 
00:01:55 : Group: Paul: so they would pay the rent ?
00:02:04 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: and if you earn alot of money in 1 day you can pop on every 7 dayz to amitain
00:02:34 : Group: Paul: yes, but if I want to play an other game, it will annoy me to have to go back to dayz
00:02:48 : Group: Paul: But the safe is a great idea
00:02:58 : Group: Paul: I'll do that to store my cash
00:02:58 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: ^^
00:03:08 : Group: Turmoil: only negative thing about the safe is that it resets after 7 days.... the code will be 0000
00:03:13 : Group: Turmoil: so make sure you hide it well
00:03:15 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: we dont care anny more about cash
00:03:25 : Group: Paul: really ?
00:03:35 : Group: Paul: well, that's nice
00:04:32 : Group: Paul: how much do you have in total ?
00:05:15 : Group: Turmoil: need to find a wheelw
00:05:24 : Group: Paul: If you want I can fly to stary and buy one
00:05:54 : Group: Paul: Let's see who brings a tire first :D
00:06:52 : Group: Paul: I go buy a tire at starya
00:07:18 : Group: Paul: tell me if you find one before
00:08:23 : Group: Paul: is there a way to know a player's humanity without asking ?
00:08:34 : Group: [NG2] Jesse: skin
00:08:36 : Group: Turmoil: not really
00:08:44 : Group: Paul: yes, but if he changes it ?
00:08:47 : Group: Paul: ok

18:52:18 : Group: Fontes: hes talking to you josh
19:00:25 : Group: LWB [SD]: now?
19:00:51 : Group: Joshuaa: yo, i was just wondering why mine and fontes' safes were removed just because we shared a base with matsa and the others?
19:01:37 : Group: LWB [SD]: We had reports from more than one player, and we suspected that they were either duping or spawning stuff, soI had to delete all thier safes Im afraid
19:02:06 : Group: LWB [SD]: That might have included yours too. I will give you some stuff, and if you find a new place for a base, Ill give you a building box
19:02:28 : Group: Joshuaa: yeah it included all of ours, we had a load of gear man haha
19:02:45 : Group: LWB [SD]: I know, sorry, but I couldnt tell what was what, so it all had to go
19:02:59 : Group: LWB [SD]: You can start fresh, but Ill give you a helping hand
19:03:05 : Group: Joshuaa: but im 100% positive they werent duping or spawning things in dude
19:03:20 : Group: Fontes: they are good guys man
19:03:39 : Group: LWB [SD]: well two separte players mentioned it, so its a bit suspicious, and they were 100 percent glitching
19:04:13 : Group: Joshuaa: could it not be that these two players have been killed by them and felt a bit butt hurt maybe?
19:04:35 : Group: LWB [SD]: I dont believe so, with one, possibly. The other I trust pretty much
19:05:04 : Group: Joshuaa: hmm ok, thanks for your time
19:05:57 : Group: LWB [SD]: Ill give you some briefs when you get to a safer spot
