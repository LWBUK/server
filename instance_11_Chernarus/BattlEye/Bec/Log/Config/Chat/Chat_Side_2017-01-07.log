11:40:56 : Side: Turmoil: you prefere the VSS becouse its silent or is it just becouse its easy to get?
11:48:45 : Side: Tobimofat: Anyone knows who the admin is, and when he/she is typically online?
11:56:34 : Side: 2DIE4: guys u r NOT allowed to mark bases in side!  
11:56:49 : Side: Tobimofat: It was a mistake sry

12:38:31 : Side: MadafackerESP: hi
12:38:37 : Side: 2DIE4: hi  =)
12:38:47 : Side: Sierra [SD]: everyone good?
12:40:45 : Side: BaffledBambi: btw admin........the ghillie at bandit trader is the wrong one
12:40:57 : Side: BaffledBambi: it's the normal one not bandit
12:41:26 : Side: Sierra [SD]: they all look the same dont they
12:41:37 : Side: BaffledBambi: nope
12:41:45 : Side: BaffledBambi: bandit is half ghillie with jeans
12:41:57 : Side: BaffledBambi: and darker
12:42:14 : Side: Sierra [SD]: so what you mean is, its not the wrong one but you would like the 1/2 ghillie at the bandit trader
12:42:30 : Side: BaffledBambi: the 1/2 ghillie is bandit lol
12:42:37 : Side: BaffledBambi: its called bandit_sniper
12:42:45 : Side: Sierra [SD]: depends how you have your server set up lol
12:42:56 : Side: LWB [SD]: The itemon sale is a ghillie, its not wrong, its a ghillie
12:43:05 : Side: 2DIE4:  it sont matter throw both in  and the desert one too
12:43:16 : Side: LWB [SD]: what you mean is the bandit one isnt for sale, which is correct
12:43:25 : Side: LWB [SD]: I shall add it now
12:43:54 : Side: BaffledBambi: what i mean is every other server has the bandit one at bandit trader and normal at hero
12:44:08 : Side: LWB [SD]: weell this aint every other server lol
12:44:08 : Side: Sierra [SD]: xD
12:44:14 : Side: BaffledBambi: i was merely poihnting it out,no need to be so defensive
12:44:30 : Side: Sierra [SD]: not - was joking with you actually lol
12:44:46 : Side: LWB [SD]: Im not, but what you are saying isnt correct.There is no right or wrong. Any one can wear any skin if they want
12:45:11 : Side: BaffledBambi: i did say you couldnt
12:45:12 : Side: 2DIE4: yeah
12:45:25 : Side: BaffledBambi: didn't*
12:45:37 : Side: BaffledBambi: what i said was you cant buy it
12:45:55 : Side: LWB [SD]: you didnt, you said it was wrong, but I know what you mean
12:46:47 : Side: BaffledBambi: hell never mind,i'll keep my opinions to myself from now on
12:47:28 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Bambi I was winding you up, I know it doesnt always come across that easily in text chat though.
12:57:30 : Side: Tobimofat: Im gonna try again since more ppl online...Does enyone know when the admin is online_
12:57:38 : Side: 2DIE4: hey whos lilbird is this here in gorka?  XD
12:57:40 : Side: LWB [SD]: err
12:57:50 : Side: 2DIE4: they r
12:58:03 : Side: LWB [SD]: I dunno, Sierra, when is admin on?
12:58:24 : Side: Sierra [SD]: we are online keeping an eye on things most of the time unless we are out or in bed
12:58:26 : Side: 2DIE4: i announce sierra and LWB to be admi
12:58:35 : Side: LWB [SD]: YAY

12:59:12 : Side: 2DIE4: admins w reallife suck  XD
12:59:19 : Side: Sierra [SD]: :P
12:59:30 : Side: LWB [SD]: ;-) I actually left the house today
12:59:37 : Side: 2DIE4: no way
12:59:52 : Side: LWB [SD]: I know, it was wierd
13:00:05 : Side: 2DIE4:  but best graphics ever  huh?  XD
13:00:24 : Side: Sierra [SD]: depends if you remember your glasses!
13:00:30 : Side: 2DIE4: hahahaha
13:00:45 : Side: LWB [SD]: Yeah, but people looked at me funny as I kept hiding in bushes and then running to the next bush
13:00:53 : Side: Sierra [SD]: cough
13:00:58 : Side: 2DIE4: yap happend to me 
13:01:16 : Side: Sierra [SD]: he's always off in a bush somewhere
13:01:23 : Side: 2DIE4:  and in the supermarket i ran through just grabbing beans and sodas  to  run stright out again
13:01:33 : Side: Sierra [SD]: xD lol
13:01:37 : Side: LWB [SD]: :D
13:01:55 : Side: Tobimofat: Do you guys help if a bug happen and you can't as an example open your safe?
13:02:08 : Side: LWB [SD]: INot if you put it in a tree no
13:03:51 : Side: LWB [SD]: If you have put it in a tree, you can chop the tree down, unlock the safe, pack it and move it
13:04:08 : Side: Tobimofat: Not in a tree but slighly touching the branches:)
13:04:13 : Side: Tobimofat: Oh okay ty
13:04:16 : Side: LWB [SD]: In a tree then ;-)
13:04:25 : Side: 2DIE4: try to reach it holding a pistol instead
13:04:53 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I think most of us have put a safe too far into a tree when we first started out
13:05:13 : Side: 2DIE4: like i said  holding the pistol gives u more options XD
13:05:24 : Side: Sierra [SD]: uh huh xD
13:05:42 : Side: Tobimofat: Have tried, but think we got a solution now :) it's my first time playing dayz for a long time, can't remember all the stuff
13:06:00 : Side: 2DIE4: i am playing this since the time where u had tents  to store stuff and nothing else
13:06:09 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yeah its easy to forget if you havent played in a while. 
13:06:21 : Side: Sierra [SD]: xD you must be practically ancient then! :P
13:06:42 : Side: 2DIE4: grrrrrr im 41  thats not ancient  XD
13:07:28 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I'm past the 30 mark so I agree!
13:07:35 : Side: 2DIE4: thx

13:38:35 : Side: Tobimofat: You were hero?
13:38:36 : Side: Sierra [SD]: sorry Gandy - I thought you were ai because I was here shooting the ai earlier before they got me
13:38:56 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I'm always a hero :) - apart from accidental shootings lol
13:39:06 : Side: Gandy: i shot one as well
13:39:11 : Side: Gandy: i understand
13:39:26 : Side: Tobimofat: Ditto- not a hero yet but im trying
13:39:32 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah ok - I wont touch your body anyway and I will move on - you can have all the gear here :)
13:39:45 : Side: Sierra [SD]: xD its quite hard work to get through the hero tiers!
13:39:50 : Side: Gandy: take it, i have no plan f returning
13:39:52 : Side: Gandy: i was a freshy
13:40:01 : Side: Gandy: and there are two good weapons
13:40:13 : Side: 2DIE4: almost a  hreo --- only 85700 to go
13:40:41 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah righty - well I shall leave them to you - haha 2DIE4 xD
13:40:50 : Side: 2DIE4: XD
13:40:51 : Side: Sierra [SD]: oh sorry
13:41:05 : Side: Sierra [SD]: missed your message b4 Gandy - thanks
13:42:19 : Side: 2DIE4: when do u get survival points? from the day of reggin on the website or is it on the game server ?
13:42:42 : Side: LWB [SD]: As soon as you buy them
13:42:49 : Side: 2DIE4: i should be able to get some perks   
13:43:01 : Side: LWB [SD]: Although we may start offering them as prizes for events too
13:43:13 : Side: 2DIE4: well where do i buy em?  i thought i earn them by playing?!
13:43:23 : Side: LWB [SD]: On the website
13:43:29 : Side: Gandy: now that is an ai
13:43:32 : Side: 2DIE4: so its a donate thing?
13:43:35 : Side: LWB [SD]: register, goto donate, then points store
13:43:37 : Side: Turmoil: lol
13:43:43 : Side: 2DIE4: ahhh i see 
13:43:57 : Side: Turmoil: does the plot poles need to be a certain distance from eachother?
13:44:03 : Side: LWB [SD]: Technically not, just a way to get some basic in game stuff
13:44:04 : Side: Gandy: y
13:44:42 : Side: 2DIE4: u may wanna thing about giving a lvl 3 bandit  a gps ... the bp does not make a big difference
13:44:51 : Side: LWB [SD]: 100m from eachother turmoil
13:45:10 : Side: 2DIE4: middle to middle ore border to border?!
13:45:12 : Side: LWB [SD]: Yeah Im currently fiddling with the levels. There will be a level 4 shortly too
13:45:29 : Side: LWB [SD]: Im not sure if itsmiddle to middle. I presume its from the border
13:45:47 : Side: Tobimofat: +5000 humanity for lvl 1 Hero?
13:45:50 : Side: Sierra [SD]: back to a lvl 2 hero :(
13:45:54 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yeah
13:45:56 : Side: LWB [SD]: yes 5000
13:46:00 : Side: 2DIE4: its the details thats importatnt  =)
13:46:00 : Side: Turmoil: then its impossible to build a base with a larger diameter than 30x30x30 then? 
13:46:26 : Side: Turmoil: isnt the range of the plotpole 30m each direction?
13:46:35 : Side: 2DIE4: and also maybe increase the plot item value to at least 200 
13:46:53 : Side: 2DIE4:  150 is a garage with antenna  XD thats like nothing   
13:47:13 : Side: LWB [SD]: Ive been through this before on old server. I incraesed plot size and items and we eneded up with immense towers that people constantly camped in
13:47:18 : Side: LWB [SD]: It ruined the game
13:47:26 : Side: LWB [SD]: So bases are limited to smaller ones now
13:47:37 : Side: Turmoil: thats cool and very understandable ^^
13:47:52 : Side: 2DIE4: im not the cmper in my base but yeah   u right 
13:48:05 : Side: 2DIE4: ppl r scafred to loose their precious stuff
13:48:13 : Side: Turmoil: would suck if bases stretched far up into the air, people would be sniping everywhere
13:48:15 : Side: LWB [SD]: If you want serveral small ones, thats fine, but I dont want great big towers and stuff. It also makes the game run crappy
13:48:55 : Side: 2DIE4: lilbird here in gorka  ....   =) 
13:49:16 : Side: 2DIE4: and two locked SUVs
14:00:46 : Side: 2DIE4: who is in the armed offroad here in gorka?  XD
14:00:54 : Side: 2DIE4: ge lost or loose ya life 
14:01:44 : Side: 2DIE4: lol fucking up the SUVs? XD
14:02:05 : Side: 2DIE4: hahahaha
14:02:36 : Side: Tobimofat: Did he crash the offroader?
14:03:08 : Side: 2DIE4: naaa maybe too close to the car  they blew  and the explosion came lill later  XD
14:03:35 : Side: 2DIE4:  not my direction fellas
14:04:11 : Side: 2DIE4: go blow that lilbird too  XD
14:08:10 : Side: Sierra [SD]: see you after the restart guys :)
14:08:15 : Side: 2DIE4: aight

14:09:39 : Side: 2DIE4: uuuuuh hello player in the barn  XD
14:34:35 : Side: Migue: How do i craft a campfire?
14:36:28 : Side: Tobimofat: Hatchet chop a tree till you get a tree pile right click it on your inventory place campfire light it with matches
14:36:43 : Side: Migue: thanks
14:38:58 : Side: Tobimofat: Does hero ai\s shoot at you
14:39:17 : Side: LWB [SD]: Yes, all Ai will shoot
14:39:28 : Side: Turmoil: everything shoots at you in this game if they have guns xD with a few exceptions :D
14:40:16 : Side: Tobimofat: But you lose humanity by shooting hero ai\s
14:40:32 : Side: Tobimofat: Right_
14:40:35 : Side: Turmoil: yeah¨i think so
14:40:51 : Side: LWB [SD]: the only hero ai's are at the hero missions, so stay away from those if you dont want to loose humanity
14:40:58 : Side: LWB [SD]: all others are bandit

20:59:59 : Side: 2DIE4:  yeah like a DMR
21:00:23 : Side: Tobimofat: The weapon you are currently using, does it use dmr mags?
21:00:27 : Side: Tobimofat: Okay
21:09:03 : Side: Tobimofat: Who dat in Rogovo_
22:49:24 : Side: Adam: why do zombies hit so hard in this
22:49:38 : Side: Adam: 2.5 k each hit
22:50:23 : Side: Marco: i guess otherwise they would not be viable with the amount of weapons available in Epoch.
22:51:37 : Side: Adam: its not hard to get guns in normal dayz
22:51:55 : Side: Adam: this just makes it so u are forced to have a silencer on  at all times
22:51:57 : Side: Marco: it's even easier here.
22:52:45 : Side: Marco: Makes it more realistic doesnt it.
22:53:02 : Side: Marco: Silenced is best anyway not to draw attention.
22:53:20 : Side: Adam: its just a stupid amount of damage for 1 hit
22:53:40 : Side: Adam: u get hit twice and u cant even aim anymore
22:53:48 : Side: Marco: Why, you'll be using guns anyway a lot instead of melee.
22:54:19 : Side: Adam: u cant aim a sniper rifle after being hit twice
22:54:28 : Side: Adam: the heart beat stops u from being able to 
23:11:39 : Side: Turmoil: hey ^^
23:12:48 : Side: Turmoil: just one
23:13:03 : Side: Turmoil: just crashed my heli in a tree
23:13:06 : Side: Turmoil: xD
23:13:08 : Side: Adam: apart from zombies doing 2.5 k damage
23:13:19 : Side: Adam: per hit
23:13:29 : Side: Turmoil: you need to shot the zombies before they hit you ^^
23:13:47 : Side: Adam: yaeh but if u dont have a silencer and are next to a mission u will die doing that
23:14:15 : Side: Marco: If zombies are still a problem for you in this game enough to complain about you need to git gud.
23:14:16 : Side: Adam: no one plays this for zombies
23:14:21 : Side: Turmoil: i do ^^
23:14:49 : Side: Adam: why do u need a heli to kill zombies
23:15:04 : Side: Turmoil: dont use it to kill zombies.... use it to get around 
23:15:45 : Side: Adam: i dont mind running zombies but when i get hit twice switching weapon and go to 6.5 k blood and cant use a sniper anymore its annoying as u can unders
23:15:49 : Side: Adam: understand
23:16:43 : Side: Marco: You can clear your sniper position before you start laying down an pumping rounds like a maniac.
23:16:44 : Side: Adam: once ur under 7 k blood u cant use a sniper because of the heartbeat
23:17:20 : Side: Adam: it depends where u are u cant clear all places 
23:17:46 : Side: Turmoil: well, im not trying to be rude, but there are also silenced weapons laying around pretty much everywhere :)
23:17:55 : Side: Adam: tried different servers they have hackers on them
23:18:04 : Side: Adam: atleast the only other good one
23:18:18 : Side: Marco: I seriously have never had the problems you descibed. But maybe Arma 3 Exile is more your thing since it's only PvP/basebuilding.
23:18:31 : Side: Marco: DayZ IS a zombie game in its base.
23:18:36 : Side: Adam: well apart from arma 3 being a terrible game
23:18:45 : Side: Marco: please....
23:19:06 : Side: Klumba: admin, we have a problem 
23:19:10 : Side: Marco: Arma 3 is just as great as this.
23:19:40 : Side: Adam: arma 3 is extreamly buggy
23:20:04 : Side: Adam: shoot someone in the head 50 times they just flop around turn around and shoot u
23:20:16 : Side: Marco: It keeps developing. Arma as a game has so much more to offer than any other AAA game out there.
23:20:21 : Side: Marco: Never had that.
23:20:47 : Side: Adam: im not a fan the hit registration is quite bad vehicles are quite op also
23:20:55 : Side: Klumba: my friend had key from heli, but he lost him because in heli no free space for weapons
23:21:04 : Side: Adam: also very laggy
23:21:35 : Side: Marco: I agree on the OP vehilces thing. But that's a balance issue. If they had better fighter/CAS planes then tanks had to watch themselves better.
23:21:51 : Side: Turmoil: i did the same thing, had to delete the veichle and buy a new one ^^
23:21:57 : Side: Klumba: can you sell heli?
23:22:01 : Side: Marco: Because the CAS planes suck the tanks have free game with their FLIR
23:22:13 : Side: Turmoil: if its unlocked you can tow it with another heli to the trader yes
23:22:16 : Side: Adam: i mean the normal veichles most of them have bullet proof flass
23:22:18 : Side: Adam: glass
23:22:36 : Side: Adam: so u cant even shoot out the driver and it just turnsinto them constantly trying to run u over
23:22:46 : Side: Turmoil: if its locked its lost if you dont have key
23:22:49 : Side: Marco: We played CTI in A3 with the F16 mod, and all of the sudden tanks cant go around carelessly anymore.
23:22:53 : Side: Adam: /
23:23:03 : Side: Klumba: he does not have humanity
23:23:12 : Side: Marco: I kinda understand, maybe they should make that dependant on calibre
23:23:26 : Side: Adam: yeah atleast in this game u can shootout drivers 
23:23:27 : Side: Marco: And give the windows health
23:24:07 : Side: Marco: But the lagg in my opionon is a pc performance issue. It just happens to be a heavy game.
23:24:11 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: adam, becuz of that i got stuck in a jeep for an hour
23:24:45 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: guy locked the jeep, got shot and i was just sitting there
23:25:03 : Side: Adam: well if i can run whicher 3 on ultra battlefield 1 on ultra its not my pc
23:25:07 : Side: Marco: In a lot of ways A3 is a way more efficient game than A2. I have about the same fps in both games, A2 is terribly optimized.
23:25:43 : Side: Marco: Maybe it's picky on pc parts?
23:26:08 : Side: Adam: i can get a solid 50 to 60 fps on ultra in those games and on arma in medium settings im lucky to get 30 
23:26:27 : Side: Adam: depending on the area obviously
23:26:47 : Side: Marco: Cities are destructive to your fps
23:26:59 : Side: Adam: yea
23:27:20 : Side: Marco: But my pc is 8yo high end and I can run A3 nearly as fine as A2.
23:28:00 : Side: Marco: First gen i7 DDR3 mobo 6gb ram nvidia GTX750.
23:28:01 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: who is president xD
23:28:20 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: he has an appointment with a 50.cal
23:28:30 : Side: Sierra [SD]: xD
23:28:55 : Side: Turmoil: Sierra? we have a bugged veichle up here, any chance of some assistance?
23:32:58 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: guys this is a special moment for me
