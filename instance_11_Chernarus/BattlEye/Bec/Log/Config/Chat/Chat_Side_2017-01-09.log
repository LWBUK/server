21:08:18 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: sry if im pissed about it
21:08:54 : Side: LWB [SD]: its just a game, live and learn. You want hackers on here all time? we havve to have as mcuhprotection as possible
21:09:11 : Side: LWB [SD]: that includes blocking certain keys and combintions
21:09:12 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: i was thinking what a bad joke is this now and all i can do is watch how i die
21:10:03 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: and ... shti happen is ak
21:10:18 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: sry i waste your time
21:16:14 : Side: LWB [SD]: Dr. Peniscillin. You clicked shift and - This is a new feature included 1.0.6 that blocks cheat entries. Try it and youll see
21:17:02 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: the turbo or fast move btn ?
21:17:08 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: LOL
21:17:39 : Side: LWB [SD]: shift and minus on numpad. Its coded into the game now
21:18:07 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: idk what this btn have to do with cheating bit thats the bigest bs in my eyes sry
21:18:34 : Side: LWB [SD]: go to he epoch github, read the 1.0.51-1.06 update changlog
21:18:39 : Side: LWB [SD]: its there in black and white
21:18:59 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: but maybe thats right i push it couse i think you fly faster
21:19:07 : Side: LWB [SD]: that combination has been used to enter a cheat menu in arma, they blocked it

21:22:06 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: alo not at flying 
21:23:11 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: but thats so bÃ¤Ã¤Ã¤ cause all knows how often you push this wrong btn
21:23:37 : Side: LWB [SD]: to be honest its a stupid system, it should block it, not freeze you,but there it is, thats the way its been done. Im always doing it too
21:25:53 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: but why the heli is fly forword and he trift to side like the same you get out and crashed
21:26:02 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: is dont fly

21:27:43 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: what you think about its good to know youre the admin let us try it out how it works with a spawned heli
21:29:05 : Side: LWB [SD]: if you stand still, press shift and -, then when it blocks you, move the mouse around.. see whst happens
21:29:44 : Side: LWB [SD]: same thing applies to helis, it seems to add your inputs all at once
21:29:50 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: im sure i dont die
21:30:04 : Side: LWB [SD]: not if you are stood somewhere no
21:30:18 : Side: LWB [SD]: unless you get shot of course
21:31:50 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: thats my bad , but i need to know that your heli gets down like you jump out
21:32:49 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: sry me english is not good enough for so diskusions
21:33:06 : Side: Dr. Peniscillin: so let us stop
21:33:41 : Side: LWB [SD]: ok. Just be careful what you press, if you do it by accdient, dont touch anything for the 5 secs
