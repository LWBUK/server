00:04:00 : Side: Marco: what do you mean?
00:04:13 : Side: Gandy: i have seen the label AI as well as this II label
00:04:32 : Side: Marco: Don't know what the difference is.
00:04:56 : Side: Marco: maybe they needed different ID's for bandit and hero NPC's.
00:05:06 : Side: Gandy: thats a good point
00:22:51 : Side: Marco: jesus fuck. the atv's are darn fuel hogs. just driving it from the trader to base is gonna drain half my tank...
00:23:09 : Side: Gandy: is there a difference etween the drinks and foods
00:23:11 : Side: Gandy: ikr

01:27:39 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: omg its been so long.....hope THIS server will be the one i stick with
01:27:50 : Side: Marco: its a good server
01:28:03 : Side: Marco: and it has been getting increasingly popular.
01:28:21 : Side: Marco: 15-20 ppl online on average
01:28:31 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: at this time?
01:28:39 : Side: Marco: nah daytime
01:28:43 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: im in the US....so this is about the time i would be on...
01:28:53 : Side: Marco: ah sorry
01:29:09 : Side: Marco: well, at this time it varies
01:29:26 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: thats fine....i play as a loaner...hide in woods....hunt....do a few ai...no big bases ..just simple stuff...
01:29:27 : Side: Marco: sometimes its like this but it also has been around 12 ppl
01:29:33 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: thats how i play stand alone
01:29:59 : Side: Marco: Well, I think you'll like this server.
01:30:00 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: its beena while ...forgot alot....how do i open my inventory...I seems to open some book
01:30:07 : Side: Marco: use G
01:30:18 : Side: Marco: I is some kind of crafting menu.
01:30:19 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: ahhh G for gear ..ok
01:30:25 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: welcome dude ^^ 
01:31:23 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: how bout..holster gun...tht it was ctrl H
01:31:41 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: just scroll.. 
01:31:53 : Side: Marco: no clue, personally I mostly use the scroll actions to switch weapons.
01:32:14 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: all i have is the pistol tho....hmmm maybve this game doesnt have the option
01:34:18 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: well today is not for real....next time i'll get on and start ..hmm melting bars and doing missions to get gold to buy stuff....to make a small camp.
01:35:09 : Side: Marco: yeah, if you can get a stash going you have a nice fallback base.
01:35:19 : Side: Marco: to begin with at least.
01:37:03 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: well that was quick......dead
01:37:13 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: i learned that the military bases have ai ...
01:38:12 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: i ran there....seen a pink suv and tht...ok ok...someone made this a home like in other servers.....then got guned down...tht it was one of u
01:38:28 : Side: Marco: nope some camps indeed have AI
01:38:55 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: ah yea it says dihini camp
01:38:57 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: yea know that camp
01:41:10 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: standing in tree and bush still keep u safe from zeds?
01:41:30 : Side: Marco: I think so, pine trees should still do the trick.
01:41:59 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: damn ....forgot..not SA...cant loot all the houses haha
01:43:43 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: did one of u kill jesssee
01:43:48 : Side: Marco: yeah
01:43:55 : Side: Marco: that was a player
01:45:49 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: OK..just making sure....i use to see it say "john was killed by adam with bla bla bla"
01:46:43 : Side: Marco: shashka, sorry to say, but you are a true pussy.
01:47:03 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: why ? shashka? 
01:48:23 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: aha damn this game creeps me out more than the SA
01:48:35 : Side: Marco: because this one is better ;p
01:49:00 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: cuz the ai are cut throats........and i cant be a total recluse because i have to go to ttown to trade and sell .....
01:49:02 : Side: Marco: SA still sucked monkeyballs last time I played it.
01:49:21 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: in sa. i only use the bow, and i only hunt and fish for my food
01:49:26 : Side: Marco: hehe
01:49:44 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: yea SA was so amazing..but it hasnt changed much so now everyone is like "well,   now what?"
01:50:05 : Side: Marco: it was exteremely laggy on my pc though.
01:50:48 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: the forest is a fun ass game...if guys never tried it.....but this game ....is its only thing
01:50:54 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: is its OWN thing
01:51:01 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: it started it all
01:51:15 : Side: Marco: ah, cool.
01:51:47 : Side: JOHNNYVAIN: ok ...server is restarting soon so i guess i'll be done tonight....are you guys regulars tho....maybe i can tag along to re learn sometime...

08:11:58 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Hi all, everything ok?
08:12:09 : Side: 2DIE4:  hi #
08:12:18 : Side: 2DIE4:  u culd do me  a favor pls
08:12:34 : Side: Sierra [SD]: depends on the favour ;)
08:12:36 : Side: Faldehals: hmmm
08:12:54 : Side: 2DIE4:  i had to put a new garage doorway on my base 
08:13:06 : Side: 2DIE4:  and its upside down wich is intended 
08:13:16 : Side: 2DIE4:  but it opens to the wrong side
08:14:09 : Side: 2DIE4: can u turn it so it opens to the outside  or at lest tell me wichside it opens to when i built i t 
08:14:44 : Side: Sierra [SD]: can't you deconstruct it and turn it the right way? - when you first place them, they open towards the way you are standing.
08:15:03 : Side: Faldehals: sacht ich doch
08:15:20 : Side: 2DIE4: they r modular and therefore they  dont get back to your inv
08:15:45 : Side: 2DIE4:  i will try  a new one then 
08:16:37 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I can't move them or change them around unfortunately. I can only delete which would have the same effect.
08:16:49 : Side: 2DIE4:  well thx anyway
08:16:51 : Side: Faldehals: im at the toilet at klen can someone bring me  toiletpaper its out here ? :/
08:17:06 : Side: 2DIE4:  XD

08:47:31 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Morning - alright?
08:47:33 : Side: KGB: салют
08:47:47 : Side: 2DIE4:  hey sierra  my key is gone ... 
08:48:04 : Side: Turmoil: dont know if its alright yet, just in to play a bit before i leave ^^ lol
08:48:43 : Side: Sierra [SD]: what do you mean its gone? - Ah right yeah - you don't have long do you?
08:49:01 : Side: Turmoil: got like... umm
08:49:02 : Side: 2DIE4: like i keep it in the safe and i cant find it 
08:49:24 : Side: Turmoil: 09:50 now so another 40 min until i gotta get in the car ^^
08:49:25 : Side: 2DIE4:  off 4  a smoke and breakfast
08:49:51 : Side: Sierra [SD]: You will have to talk to LWB about that one - we don't usually give out keys 
08:50:01 : Side: Sierra [SD]: righty
08:50:30 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah right - you have time to get something done then :)
08:53:14 : Side: Turmoil: why do cats have to be such A-Holes sometimes? -_-
08:53:39 : Side: Sierra [SD]: :D - why what happened?
08:54:01 : Side: Turmoil: jumped up on the kitchen counter and managed to break a glass *sighs*
08:54:53 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah - to show their superiority to the human race? xD
08:55:10 : Side: Turmoil: i guess thats the reason... sometimes i just wanna strangle them
08:55:36 : Side: Sierra [SD]: xD
08:57:08 : Side: Sierra [SD]: sods law they will break something when you have little time because you are going out & want to enjoy playing your game! :P
08:57:25 : Side: Turmoil: yeah xD
08:57:47 : Side: Turmoil: well, most of the time they are cute and cuddly... but like you said, when you really dont have time for the stuff they do something wrong
09:00:09 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yep! Haven't actually had a cat in the house since I was a child but he was a sweet cat. Not very clever but sweet.
09:01:29 : Side: Turmoil: it seems to me like most cats act stupid...
09:01:47 : Side: Sierra [SD]: xD
09:01:56 : Side: Turmoil: but im sure that they secretly are planning to kill us and rule the world... they got to have a plan in all their madness xD
09:02:44 : Side: Sierra [SD]: lol yes - some of them do seem to look at you a bit shiftily when they think you arent looking! :P
09:03:59 : Side: Turmoil: hows work today? ^^
09:04:15 : Side: Sierra [SD]: not too bad thanks - phone started early!

09:06:20 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah right yeah - LWB watches one like - 24h in A&E or something like that
09:06:56 : Side: Turmoil: yeah, except this one was inside the main hospital, long term patients etc
09:07:09 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah right - sounds interesting
09:07:38 : Side: Turmoil: hey, just wondering btw... are LWB planing on adding more guns and cars etc to the game? ^^
09:10:16 : Side: Sierra [SD]: oops lol
09:10:39 : Side: Turmoil: sucide or forgot to eat? xD
09:10:54 : Side: Sierra [SD]: neither - got up to let the dog back in at a mission xD
09:11:12 : Side: Turmoil: ooooh, lol
09:11:48 : Side: Sierra [SD]: This is why I can't do mythic dungeons and raids with people :D
09:11:58 : Side: Sierra [SD]: always things to be done :D
09:12:15 : Side: Turmoil: lol, well im the quite oposit... if i have to use the toilet etc i just keep it in until im done with what im doing xD

10:21:05 : Side: 2DIE4: relog  
10:29:49 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Hiya - sorry I wasn't on the screen 2DIE4 - I think you will have to speak to LWB later as I'm not sure what happened to your key and we don't 
10:29:54 : Side: Sierra [SD]: usually give out spares.
10:30:22 : Side: 2DIE4:   im just wondering since i havent moved the chopper and i keep it in the safe when its not in use
10:31:10 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Yeah. There isnt really any way of us telling how it has gone missing I'm afraid, but like I said you can speak to LWB later and see what he says.
10:31:38 : Side: 2DIE4:  ok   i will = )  thx
10:31:51 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I'm not sure exactly when he will be back but I have mentioned it to him already.
10:32:04 : Side: 2DIE4:  i know there is sometimes things buggin out the safe 4 no reason ... 
10:32:40 : Side: 2DIE4:  had it on the other server one day.. all my big boom booms and the toolbeltitems were gone .  like all weapon slots    
10:33:38 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Yeah. I don't think we have had any major problems like that yet. I'll remind him about it when I get in later.
10:37:10 : Side: MeGa_Koffiepot: can you boil your water bottel?

11:05:00 : Side: 2DIE4:   thats just pussy stile  acting =)
11:05:48 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ;)
11:06:10 : Side: 2DIE4:  dont u tzhink ?   i mean someone playing alone cant compete on vehicle missions 
11:08:30 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Yeah maybe - personally I don't know why people bother running over the ai anyway - 1/2 the fun of the mission is shooting out the ai. I'm not sure 
11:08:37 : Side: Sierra [SD]: you get humanity if you run them over
11:09:29 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I shall pass your suggestion onto LWB :)

15:51:00 : Side: M.K.: what's with the whole carrying and holding in inventory?
15:51:17 : Side: M.K.: is it a addon from this server only or from the new epoch/dayz update?
15:51:41 : Side: M.K.: can someone answer plesae?
15:51:55 : Side: Winans: its the banana 3.3 mod
15:52:02 : Side: M.K.: thanks mate
15:52:06 : Side: M.K.: lwb
15:52:19 : Side: M.K.: so the new interface is also from the new dayz update?
15:52:58 : Side: M.K.: it seems a bit off / modded, i played a while ago a ton of dayz and now it seems a bit strange but in a good way
15:53:04 : Side: M.K.: i mean the inventory interface
15:53:30 : Side: M.K.: oh sweet so they update it, i thought it was on this server only
15:53:59 : Side: M.K.: meh its alright
15:54:00 : Side: M.K.: but
15:54:15 : Side: M.K.: i didnt see before this "carrying / holding " thing
15:54:21 : Side: Winans: how come i killed 2 ppl today but my humanity did not change at all
15:54:22 : Side: M.K.: so thats why i asked
15:55:04 : Side: M.K.: whenever im planing on starting to play dayz mod again im always looking for a good server to stay on , to worth the time spent on it
15:55:16 : Side: M.K.: without many addons and useless things
15:55:28 : Side: M.K.: and i hope i made the right choice with this one
15:55:31 : Side: M.K.: :D

19:08:04 : Side: [RussianMafia]gg_teemo: whether it is possible to attack the server datebase?
19:08:14 : Side: LWB [SD]: ?
19:08:26 : Side: [RussianMafia]Hatter: raid bases?
19:08:32 : Side: [RussianMafia]gg_teemo: yes

19:10:04 : Side: VPr3stigious: once i have the crowbar, then what?

19:10:25 : Side: 2DIE4:  well crowbar + toolbox i think..... 
19:10:44 : Side: 2DIE4:  works like the ammo crates   that hold mainly vehicle ammo
19:10:53 : Side: LWB [SD]:  think it has a scroll wheel message like deconstuct
19:10:59 : Side: VPr3stigious: hmm 
19:11:01 : Side: 2DIE4:  u destroy it then u deconstruct the pile
19:11:03 : Side: VPr3stigious: thanks

21:01:46 : Side: Mr Sin: Sierra

21:04:12 : Side: PRISMIC: /
21:04:32 : Side: LWB [SD]: We dont sell donation perks, so we dont need to. 
21:04:45 : Side: Mr Sin: So you don't sell build packages on your website?
21:04:50 : Side: LWB [SD]: nope
21:05:14 : Side: Mr Sin: Whats a large base building package for 15 points
21:05:24 : Side: LWB [SD]: for points.. not money
21:05:36 : Side: Mr Sin: Thats still against their terms.
21:05:41 : Side: LWB [SD]: Im afraid it isnt
21:05:50 : Side: Mr Sin: I'm afraid they would see differently.
21:05:56 : Side: LWB [SD]: Im afriad they wouldnt
21:06:03 : Side: Mr Sin: Ok.
21:06:15 : Side: LWB [SD]: What does it matter to you anyhow?
21:06:37 : Side: Mr Sin: It doesn't
21:06:40 : Side: Mr Sin: A donation is a gift
21:06:44 : Side: Mr Sin: With nothing recieved in return
21:07:04 : Side: Mr Sin: It says, "you do not offere any perks or rewards for such donations and players do not expect anything back"
21:07:06 : Side: LWB [SD]: exactly.. Poeple can donate on the website and recieve nothing, thats made perfectly clear there
21:07:21 : Side: Mr Sin: Its for your guys benefit, not mine.
21:07:31 : Side: Mr Sin: They will send cease and desists
21:07:35 : Side: LWB [SD]: I can assure you everything is above board
21:07:42 : Side: Mr Sin: It's clearly not.
21:07:57 : Side: Mr Sin: People give you money, they recieve points.
21:08:04 : Side: Mr Sin: Those points can be spent on build packages.
21:08:46 : Side: LWB [SD]: Points are given out in many ways, and can be used for whatever purpose players want
21:09:15 : Side: Mr Sin: Give them out in many ways, thats cool, just not when people give you money. That's bad
21:09:49 : Side: LWB [SD]: If yu would like to discussthis further, please do, but not here. Eveything is above board whether you think it or not
21:10:23 : Side: Mr Sin: Again, I was only trying to help you guys.
21:10:30 : Side: Mr Sin: It was for your benefit
21:10:32 : Side: Mr Sin: Not mine
21:10:48 : Side: LWB [SD]: Well, I appreciate it, but I know we are all good on that front
