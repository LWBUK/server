12:35:35 : Side: [RussianMafia]ICEE: Hi
12:36:07 : Side: Sierra [SD]: :)
12:36:13 : Side: Turmoil: did you oversleep today? xD 
12:36:17 : Side: Turmoil: havent seen you on earlier
12:36:49 : Side: Sierra [SD]: nope haha :D - no I haven't been near a computer all morning
12:37:04 : Side: Turmoil: alot of stuff to do? 
12:38:04 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Walked the dog early because it was nice and frosty with a bit of snow then found out everyone had decided to have a day off so went food shopping  
12:38:09 : Side: Sierra [SD]: early too
12:38:24 : Side: Turmoil: oh so actually no work today? :D
12:38:58 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Well the phone never stops ringing but apart from that :)
12:39:05 : Side: Turmoil: lol
12:39:33 : Side: Turmoil: i keep my phone on silent when im not at work... so if i dont see it ringing i dont care about it at all ^^
12:40:03 : Side: Sierra [SD]: xD - well we can't exactly ignore work calls. We'd have no customers left! :P
12:40:28 : Side: Turmoil: true true ^^ hey, got a question, i have the merlin heli, but after each restart its all empty of fuel...
12:40:42 : Side: Turmoil: so whenever i land before a restart i must land near a refueling station
12:40:56 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yeah - again a dayz thing unless your windows are broken?
12:41:25 : Side: Turmoil: they seem fine, i also repaired it just to be sure earlier today
12:42:15 : Side: Turmoil: its not leaking fuel... its just empty every single time the server restarts
12:42:33 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yeah - it is a known bug - just happens to some heli's sometimes. Add it to the list of weird stuff that happens! xD
12:42:57 : Side: Turmoil: will do xD
13:03:11 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I found a pet piggy and his name is Mr Oinksworth
13:32:03 : Side: Turmoil: missed :)

14:06:31 : Side: herma: no, down by the hunger and thirst meters
14:06:33 : Side: Sierra [SD]: No sorry, bases get too big otherwise I am afraid.
