17:11:21 : Side: RyanTheSloth: ?
17:18:33 : Side: Lunatick : lwb do you think you could make the plot pole build limit higher 
17:18:42 : Side: svvay: agreed^
17:18:49 : Side: matsa: agreed
17:19:04 : Side: BowDownYaBish: LWB, how come it's saying I have not got enough money even though I have 2 ruby's on me?
17:19:08 : Side: LWB [SD]: we are discussing it, but the performance of the server has to be considered as well.
17:19:20 : Side: LWB [SD]: becuase you need to sell the rubys
17:19:25 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Where at?
17:19:31 : Side: LWB [SD]: buidling dude
17:19:34 : Side: BowDownYaBish: nvm got it
17:19:48 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Wait ruby's are only 1 bc now?
17:19:53 : Side: BowDownYaBish: they used to be 5
17:20:07 : Side: LWB [SD]: they are default, I havent changed them from whatever the devs set it too
17:20:38 : Side: RyanTheSloth: do vehicles randomly spawn or do you have to buy them?
17:20:47 : Side: LWB [SD]: there are randowm ones yes
17:20:54 : Side: RyanTheSloth: spicy
17:21:28 : Side: BowDownYaBish: So I turned 5 bc's into a ruby and now I can only sell them for 1 bc? xD
17:21:58 : Side: LWB [SD]: how did you get 5b/c to a ruby?
17:22:09 : Side: BowDownYaBish: When the server first went up
17:22:18 : Side: BowDownYaBish: It was 5 bc's to make 1 ruby
17:22:18 : Side: LWB [SD]: ah ok
17:22:31 : Side: LWB [SD]: well market value has changed, times are tough
17:22:31 : Side: BowDownYaBish: So my 40 bc's just turned into 8?
17:28:10 : Side: 2DIE4:  so admin .... if we payed 5 BCs for a ruby b4  r w gonna get refundet 4 the loss of the inflation?
17:32:32 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Is m134 ammo ever going to be reduced in price?
17:32:43 : Side: BowDownYaBish: It's over half the price of the BH xD
17:33:15 : Side: svvay: you can find 'em in the cratesd
17:33:25 : Side: BowDownYaBish: But only a few at a time
17:33:38 : Side: LWB [SD]: cant you rearm at fuel sations too for a lot cheaper
17:33:45 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Oh okay
17:34:01 : Side: LWB [SD]: I think, dont quote me
17:36:07 : Side: bobaliny2: lwb
17:36:16 : Side: bobaliny2: Will higher end vehicles ever be added to the traders?
17:36:19 : Side: bobaliny2: l/ike bandit and hero traders
17:36:33 : Side: LWB [SD]: probably not. Just causes trouble
17:36:45 : Side: bobaliny2: Aw
17:36:48 : Side: bobaliny2: but they're fun
17:37:00 : Side: LWB [SD]: forthe people who have them, not so much for those that dont
17:37:34 : Side: bobaliny2: yOu could just add them to the hero :) encourage less pvp by only giving good stuff to high humanity :)
17:38:42 : Side: LWB [SD]: Most groups have a hero and buy them for nefarious purposes
17:38:59 : Side: bobaliny2: sure
17:39:15 : Side: LWB [SD]: If you introduce more armed vehcicles, you also need to introduce ways to get them like rockets and stuff
17:39:48 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Rockets are fine, but nothing with Thermal/lock on imo
17:39:52 : Side: Lunatick : dont think he mean add a tank 
17:39:59 : Side: LWB [SD]: no, thermal is never happening
17:40:10 : Side: BowDownYaBish: That's what I'm saying
17:40:10 : Side: [KRT]Uku: I hate when there are tanks ingame
17:40:17 : Side: M.K.: same here
17:40:19 : Side: LWB [SD]: what else is there tho, btr.. lav
17:40:24 : Side: LWB [SD]: they are useless
17:40:26 : Side: M.K.: the it is now is perfect
17:40:33 : Side: Lunatick : rpgs would be fine just no lock ons 
17:40:34 : Side: BowDownYaBish: BRDM
17:40:39 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Remove the KPTV
17:40:43 : Side: BowDownYaBish: LAV is good
17:40:44 : Side: M.K.: brdms are good
17:41:19 : Side: LWB [SD]: maybe. Its the sort of thing that needs a big vote on the forum
17:41:59 : Side: LWB [SD]: no A10's or wildcats though. Aint going through that crap again :D
17:42:38 : Side: [KRT]ImMagu: byplanes with guns
17:42:56 : Side: LWB [SD]: the an2?
17:44:03 : Side: [KRT]ImMagu: maybe
17:44:08 : Side: BowDownYaBish: AN2 with vikkers is good but not too OP, quite hard to use actually
17:45:20 : Side: BowDownYaBish: RIP armed SUV
17:45:39 : Side: svvay: it was a mission vehicle anyways :p
17:49:07 : Side: M.K.: can you manage groups from the radio station aswell?
17:49:19 : Side: M.K.: or however it is called
17:49:19 : Side: [RussianMafia]gg_teemo: ahahahahhaha4

18:15:35 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: no change? 
18:15:41 : Side: BowDownYaBish: ?
18:16:07 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: just flying in a mozzie and you shoot me from your cchopper GG 
18:16:24 : Side: BowDownYaBish: You followed us, we were going to leave you
18:16:26 : Side: Lunatick : oooh you mad 
18:16:45 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: no i am not mad,.. 
18:16:49 : Side: M.K.: so can you manage groups from the radio aswell?
18:17:01 : Side: LWB [SD]: no, just press f5
18:17:04 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: its funny that you just shoot randomely
18:17:07 : Side: M.K.: kk
18:17:22 : Side: Lunatick : well it wasnt random it was at you 
18:17:44 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: yea true crazy bandits
18:23:39 : Side: Lunatick : lwb have you though about putting vehicles that are in range of a plot pole not to be blown up 
18:24:07 : Side: Sierra [SD]: yes and we don't want to do that because we will end up with too many vehicles & the server will get laggy
18:24:10 : Side: LWB [SD]: Been there on last server. Ended up with 30+ vehicles at one base that couldnt be destroyed
18:24:29 : Side: BowDownYaBish: You should add the garage system
18:24:41 : Side: Lunatick : agreed 
18:25:05 : Side: LWB [SD]: nah, defeats the purpose in my opinon. Where is the danger? Dayz is about danger
18:25:13 : Side: LWB [SD]: or should be
18:25:17 : Side: M.K.: totaly agree
18:25:47 : Side: BowDownYaBish: You would still lose vehicles but it would stop people blowing shit up when the owners aren;t online
18:26:03 : Side: Lunatick : yh but when people just go up to your base and destroy all of your vehicles that you worked on getting
18:26:04 : Side: bobaliny2: My response to that is protect shit better
18:26:05 : Side: bobaliny2: or hide it
18:26:10 : Side: svvay: ^this
18:26:13 : Side: LWB [SD]: you cant loose vehciles that are stored in a database though
18:26:42 : Side: Lunatick : bobaliny has your base been kimied yet 
18:26:51 : Side: 2DIE4:  u can loose them using them  = ) 
18:26:52 : Side: Lunatick : kamied 
18:26:52 : Side: bobaliny2: haven't built one yet
18:27:05 : Side: BowDownYaBish: When you take them out of the garage you can be shot and lose it and also when you're going around the map in the vehicles
18:27:08 : Side: bobaliny2: But i've played long enough to know it can be countered
18:27:22 : Side: svvay: Bad idea BowDown, makes the game lose it's value
18:27:25 : Side: Lunatick : well then you cant hide stuff if all is needed is to ram the base and all vehicles in side will blow up 
18:27:36 : Side: bobaliny2: Don't leave you vehicles in your base then
18:27:44 : Side: bobaliny2: Have a secondary spot
18:27:49 : Side: 2DIE4:  base makes NO sense then
18:27:53 : Side: bobaliny2: Sure it does
18:27:57 : Side: bobaliny2: Keep your items there
18:27:58 : Side: Lunatick : what the fucking point of having  a base then 
18:27:59 : Side: 2DIE4:  not at all
18:28:01 : Side: bobaliny2: Keep teh easily blown up things away
18:28:11 : Side: bobaliny2: Y'all are just shitty that you aren't problem solvers
18:28:13 : Side: 2DIE4:  u full of it  dude
18:28:18 : Side: LWB [SD]: Its an issue that will never be agreed on as everyone thinks and plays different
18:28:19 : Side: svvay: Sounds like 2die4 has encountered this before
18:28:23 : Side: Sierra [SD]: If this is going to decend into an argument I suggest you all take this elsewhere.
18:28:42 : Side: M.K.: ^^
18:28:53 : Side: 2DIE4:  how much is a cessna?
18:29:11 : Side: LWB [SD]: So we have the set up we have and thats the way it is. Ive increased the base items slightly to allow for more protection
18:29:18 : Side: Lunatick : all it was we shouted out an option and the whole server shut us down thats all 
18:29:32 : Side: svvay: lel
18:30:23 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Cessna's are 6 x 10oz gold to buy.
18:30:50 : Side: Lunatick : me and bow were on the last server that lwb had and it was better with the no kami rule 
18:31:20 : Side: LWB [SD]: But it caused us a hell of a lot of trouble enforcing it
18:31:43 : Side: Lunatick : so becasue you couldnt enforce a rule you toook it out 
18:31:45 : Side: LWB [SD]: we have better things to do than check logs constantly to see if someone did or didnt have something they say they did
18:31:58 : Side: LWB [SD]: if people were honest it wouldnt be an issue
18:32:00 : Side: LWB [SD]: but they arent
18:32:27 : Side: BowDownYaBish: You should just say that you NEED evidence to ban someone, if someone has no proof then nothing can be done, makes your job easier
18:32:29 : Side: Lunatick : its not that i mean if the person that got kamid had proof it would be a bannable offense 
18:33:09 : Side: LWB [SD]: But sometimes people loose conenction and the plane/heli crashes and it was accidental. It ends up he said/she said
18:33:23 : Side: Lunatick : oki what ever 
18:33:42 : Side: 2DIE4:  its all good  .. well be the bandits yall dont want  =)
18:33:47 : Side: BowDownYaBish: That's when you should ask them for proof of them losing connection, if they can't provide it then they stay banned
18:34:27 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Food for thought maybe, idk, just think about it abit
18:39:14 : Side: Christmas: thanks for the help yesterday lwb
18:39:27 : Side: LWB [SD]: no worries
18:40:18 : Side: Lunatick : i thought devils was a no build area 
18:40:38 : Side: Christmas: just missions to do now they just as simple?
18:40:41 : Side: LWB [SD]: nope, never has been
18:40:46 : Side: Lunatick : ah ok 
18:40:58 : Side: LWB [SD]: WAI is one line install yes
18:41:19 : Side: 2DIE4:  didnt u mention it to someone NOT to built there?!
18:41:28 : Side: LWB [SD]: Nope
18:41:43 : Side: LWB [SD]: Someone accused us of saying that
18:41:54 : Side: LWB [SD]: I chekced every single chat log since 28th december
18:41:58 : Side: LWB [SD]: It was never said
18:42:19 : Side: LWB [SD]: A player sais he didnt know when asked. Me or Sierra have never said it
18:42:26 : Side: Christmas: sure its just military spawns and air fields 
18:42:27 : Side: Lunatick : ok dw 
18:42:39 : Side: LWB [SD]: If you can place a plot, its builable. Its all code driven
18:45:48 : Side: Christmas: you cant repack a mozzie can you 
18:45:53 : Side: svvay: yas
18:45:54 : Side: Lunatick : no
18:45:56 : Side: bobaliny2: You can
18:46:03 : Side: Lunatick : unless its the one you deployed 
18:46:34 : Side: Christmas: good 
18:47:41 : Side: bobaliny2: lwb
18:47:47 : Side: bobaliny2: why are teh names backwards on the kill messages
18:47:54 : Side: bobaliny2: Like the victim is first
18:48:03 : Side: LWB [SD]: xx was killed by zz
18:48:03 : Side: svvay: the gun points at the victim xd
18:48:13 : Side: LWB [SD]: Just the way it was made by the devs
18:48:23 : Side: bobaliny2: lmao it makes so much more sense that xx killed zz
18:48:30 : Side: bobaliny2: every game ever does it that way XD
