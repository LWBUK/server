10:09:51 : Side: Stiefelriemen Bill: are cinder block walls indestructible?
10:09:59 : Side: Turmoil: nope
10:10:27 : Side: Stiefelriemen Bill: can they just get destroyed with a chainsaw and enough fuel?
10:10:35 : Side: Stiefelriemen Bill: or any weapon
10:11:02 : Side: Turmoil: if i remember correctly it takes between 2500-3000 .50cal to break it
10:11:15 : Side: Stiefelriemen Bill: ok thanks
11:06:16 : Side: 2DIE4:  Sierra---
11:06:41 : Side: 2DIE4:  would u pls check if someone glitched into our base ... like all the gold is gone  OUT OF THE SAFE
11:08:35 : Side: Turmoil: can they glitch into the safes as well? 
11:08:38 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I can only see if glitched if there is a video of it or something - they can't glitch into a safe though for sure.
11:08:46 : Side: Sierra [SD]: No - you cant glitch into safes.
11:09:02 : Side: 2DIE4:  but u can check who accessed the safe right
11:09:16 : Side: Sierra [SD]: No I can't check anything like that.
11:09:35 : Side: 2DIE4:  all gold and gems gone eccept the ones i put in there now
11:09:57 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Not even sure if LWB can - it might show up in the logs possibly. 
11:10:23 : Side: Turmoil: when are you dropping by for a cup of coffee sierra? xD
11:11:09 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Will ask him if he can look later. What time did you first notice the problem?
11:11:18 : Side: 2DIE4: jus tnow 
11:12:58 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Ok - so 11ish - 11:10 gmt maybe? xD have just had one Turmoil, wouldn't mind another though.
11:13:21 : Side: Turmoil: your welcome to visit, i finally moved out from the others xD 
11:13:56 : Side: Sierra [SD]: haha :D - I'll have to come and take a look. 
11:14:34 : Side: Sierra [SD]: let me come take a look now 2DIE4 and take some screenshots of the safe as it is. 
11:14:45 : Side: 2DIE4: i just now noticed ... it was all good yesteray
11:15:51 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Yeah - like a said there is a possiblilty the logs will show who last accessed it and what they removed. LWB will have to look when he is back from 
11:15:53 : Side: Sierra [SD]: work though
11:38:10 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: Sierra?
11:38:23 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: i have a question for u ma'am
11:38:54 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: is there a chance you can make this Soldier happy and put day night cycle in the game?
11:40:33 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Hi Sir LongSleeves, not current plans to add a day/night cycle sorry because the majority of players aren't keen. There is the voting system, but as
11:40:44 : Side: Sierra [SD]: im sure you can tell, its not popular to vote night :)
11:41:12 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: i know, most of them are just to scared to go night xD
11:41:48 : Side: Sir LongSleeves: i should start a spec ops training session for that hahaha

19:41:56 : Side: VPr3stigious: you hunted me and tried to kill me for no reason, then asked if camping the traders was not allowed
19:42:04 : Side: VPr3stigious: which means you were thinking of sitting there and waiting

19:42:22 : Side: JamesDaGamer: you're on crack
19:42:25 : Side: BowDownYaBish: i asked if fleeing to traders was allowed
19:42:44 : Side: BowDownYaBish: I shot you like 1.5km north of Stary and you flew right into safezone
19:42:50 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Which is why I asked
19:42:54 : Side: VPr3stigious: I WAS FLYING TO STARY dickhead
19:43:04 : Side: VPr3stigious: I took off to go to stary.
19:43:13 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Doesn't mean anything to me
19:43:25 : Side: BowDownYaBish: For all I know you could be making that up

20:03:00 : Side: Cristi: Well how about you didn't loot us? 
20:03:05 : Side: Cristi: If you are so kind
20:03:15 : Side: Hailstorm: that was winans, i didnt loot you
20:03:40 : Side: Cristi: Well, you're both in the same base.
20:03:45 : Side: Hailstorm: i know
20:03:54 : Side: Cristi: I think it's a bit too late to start a friendship honestly. Don't know what to say.
20:04:02 : Side: LWB [SD]: Yes Im back. ammo is in another safe,well will be after restart
20:04:03 : Side: Hailstorm: i could kill you there but i didnt shot from my base
20:04:33 : Side: 2DIE4:  sweet    ... we was like wtf?   
20:04:58 : Side: Hailstorm: yes, it wasnt my fault... sierra -.-
20:05:36 : Side: Sierra [SD]: I will back you up on this one Hail - it was probably a panic reaction because he had just been tp'd from the event.
20:05:53 : Side: Hailstorm: ^^
20:06:03 : Side: Hailstorm: 20 meters next to them ^^
20:06:24 : Side: Cristi: Wtf. You were teleported there?
20:06:30 : Side: Hailstorm: yep
20:06:37 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Yes from after the event.
20:06:41 : Side: Hailstorm: i was in panic, had 1 bc inthe backpack
20:06:43 : Side: Cristi: Well that's not cool.
20:06:53 : Side: Cristi: Jeez.
20:07:09 : Side: Hailstorm: yep, littlebit uncool
20:07:56 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Who's in this Merlin?
20:08:37 : Side: Hailstorm: winans is painting everything with blood

20:09:03 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: its me on the merlin
20:09:10 : Side: BowDownYaBish: Okay cool
20:09:33 : Side: Cristi: Well, the thing is Hail.. even though I didn't want trouble with you. You are in the hard spot now.
20:09:36 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: why?
20:09:41 : Side: Cristi: We can just relocate somewhere where you won't find us.
20:09:45 : Side: Cristi: But we know where your base is.
20:09:52 : Side: Hailstorm: i know
20:10:09 : Side: Winans: do whatever the fk u want
20:10:17 : Side: Hailstorm: WINANS
20:11:17 : Side: Cristi: Well it's obvious that even though we'd truce with you your friend would always look for revenge.
20:11:30 : Side: Cristi: So.. I hope that 1 bc was worth it :( 
20:11:34 : Side: Hailstorm: :/
20:12:23 : Side: Cristi: Honestly I'd be ok with you just returning what you took and we can part ways. But my friends really weren't into getting executed like that
20:12:49 : Side: Cristi: You see.. out of the 5 of us, only I try to be the hero.
20:13:01 : Side: Cristi: Maybe the same way with you and winans :D
