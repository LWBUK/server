09:45:56 : Side: Faldehals: sierra ?
09:47:09 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Yes Faldehals
09:47:26 : Side: Faldehals: i found a safe with rockets
09:47:50 : Side: Faldehals: but no louncher
09:48:47 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Ah right
09:49:17 : Side: Faldehals: aha
09:49:52 : Side: Faldehals: also i dont need to keep it ?
09:50:19 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ?
09:50:37 : Side: Faldehals: the rockets HEAT anti tank
09:51:10 : Side: Faldehals: or can i get the louncher at a mission ?
09:51:13 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Yes but I don't quite understand what you are getting at 
09:51:16 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ah ok
09:51:26 : Side: Sierra [SD]: no you can't get the launchers
09:52:00 : Side: Faldehals: but why the rockets ... cheatet ?
09:52:16 : Side: Sierra [SD]: Well depends on how many I guess but they did used to be in the loot table.
09:52:59 : Side: Sierra [SD]: By accident. People were finding them but you can't do anything with them
09:53:33 : Side: Sierra [SD]: If there is a load of them its possible they might have been spawned in by someone cheating though.
09:54:40 : Side: Sierra [SD]: where abouts did you find them - I will have a look.
09:54:48 : Side: Faldehals: also i can drop it wasnt sure what is to do with that
09:55:17 : Side: Sierra [SD]: they are not worth anything - you can't sell them either
09:55:20 : Side: Faldehals: you can i put it in a lockbox at this barn
09:55:50 : Side: Sierra [SD]: ok - is that the place where you found them?
09:56:11 : Side: Faldehals: ja but not at my position
09:56:46 : Side: Faldehals: come here pls dont like to tell in side
09:56:53 : Side: Faldehals: lol
