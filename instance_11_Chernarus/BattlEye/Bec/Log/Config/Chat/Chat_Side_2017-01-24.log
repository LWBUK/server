13:08:31 : Side: 2DIE4:  ok ????  how would u get over there?
13:09:11 : Side: Arne: you can land with a mozzie on the small platform to the left of your garage door(just next to the rooked metal floor)
13:09:20 : Side: 2DIE4: u cant get over the garage door without a glitch
13:09:32 : Side: Arne: and then walk to the top of your garage door, go gown to the cinder wall and crawl in
13:09:43 : Side: 2DIE4:  ahh ok
13:09:46 : Side: Arne: yes easily

14:26:55 : Side: Hailstorm: military offroad special
14:27:16 : Side: Arne: would that knock down a building?
14:27:24 : Side: Arne: need to know, for science
14:27:52 : Side: 2DIE4:  they r not even that strong i think
14:27:54 : Side: Hailstorm: yes, every gun can do this, but you need a lot af amunition
14:28:13 : Side: Arne: ok. can you buy satchel charges?
14:28:15 : Side: Paul: I see my body but can't access inventory :/
14:28:17 : Side: Arne: somewhere

14:30:08 : Side: Arne: not base
14:30:25 : Side: 2DIE4:  sure if u spend enopugh money on ammo

14:30:38 : Side: freedom: ya damn terroist
14:30:43 : Side: Arne: damn
14:31:03 : Side: Arne: ant afford that. Well somebody stole my base, so it only seems fair

14:43:09 : Side: Paul: any idea ?
14:43:29 : Side: Hailstorm: hmmm, not really
14:43:33 : Side: freedom: you try zooming in on it
14:43:45 : Side: Paul: with right click ?
14:43:49 : Side: freedom: yes
14:43:53 : Side: Arne: is it close to a tree?
14:44:06 : Side: Paul: it's half under a barn
14:44:21 : Side: Paul: and the barn got destroyed in a mozzie crash

14:44:40 : Side: freedom: lol
14:44:41 : Side: Paul: thanks for the tip !
14:44:41 : Side: Arne: gg
14:47:27 : Side: Paul: I was wondering, if I put a backpack in a tent, will it keep its content ?
14:47:36 : Side: Arne: no
14:47:38 : Side: 2DIE4: no
14:47:39 : Side: Hailstorm: not after restart
14:47:46 : Side: Paul: ok, thanks
14:47:50 : Side: freedom: i tried once and after restart was gone
14:47:51 : Side: 2DIE4:  not tent nore any other 
14:48:01 : Side: 2DIE4:  no safe, lockbock shed or vehicle
14:48:33 : Side: Hailstorm: yes, after restart the content is gone, where ever you had the backpack stored
14:48:45 : Side: Paul: thank you
14:48:51 : Side: Hailstorm: np
14:49:38 : Side: Hailstorm: im on the best way to become a hero ^^... -31000 humanity
14:49:58 : Side: [KRT]Uku: 2DIE4 how much was yours ? :D
14:50:21 : Side: Hailstorm: think much more...
14:50:23 : Side: 2DIE4: how much was what?
14:50:30 : Side: Hailstorm: humanity
14:50:55 : Side: 2DIE4: 157K-
14:51:00 : Side: Hailstorm: gj
14:51:08 : Side: Hailstorm: bad bad bandit
14:51:16 : Side: [KRT]Uku: How long time have you been on the server ?
14:51:16 : Side: 2DIE4: i try NOT to kill that much  Xd
14:51:28 : Side: 2DIE4:  dunno ... maybe a month now
14:52:57 : Side: Arne: if you want to know.. mk19 tears through a building like butter
14:53:21 : Side: Hailstorm: the building is down O.O
14:53:30 : Side: Paul: If I'm a basic guy and enter the Ural hero circle, what happens ?d
14:53:46 : Side: freedom: they shoot you
14:53:46 : Side: [KRT]Uku: nothing
14:53:51 : Side: Paul: who ?
14:53:51 : Side: [KRT]Uku: oh that way
14:53:59 : Side: [KRT]Uku: in mission yea
14:54:02 : Side: [KRT]Uku: they shoot
14:54:10 : Side: Paul: the heroes or the bandits ?q
14:54:14 : Side: [KRT]Uku: both
14:54:16 : Side: freedom: any mission will shoot you hero or not
14:54:25 : Side: 2DIE4:  entering the circle sets the AI to alarm .. and on heavy missions they will bring in reinforcements
14:54:43 : Side: Paul: But can I complete it if I'm not a hero ?z
14:54:50 : Side: 2DIE4:  sure 
14:54:55 : Side: 2DIE4:  if u dont get shot =9
14:54:59 : Side: Paul: nice, thanks
14:55:24 : Side: freedom: he will lose humanity on hero missions though right
14:55:34 : Side: 2DIE4:  yap
14:55:40 : Side: Arne: yes
14:55:57 : Side: freedom: roger
14:55:57 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: if you kill bandits ai you gain humanity and if you kill hero ai you lose some
14:56:08 : Side: freedom: right thats what i thought
14:56:23 : Side: 2DIE4:  u get humanity by killing zombis aswell
14:56:35 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: yes
14:56:58 : Side: 2DIE4: +5 per Z
15:24:04 : Side: Paul: I was wondring, is everyone friendly here or do some people kill on sight ?
15:24:39 : Side: freedom: im friendly and also been shot on sight a few times
15:24:58 : Side: Turmoil: most people shoot on sight in this game 
15:25:44 : Side: freedom: trying to be a hero so i dont shoot on sight try to talk first
15:26:31 : Side: Turmoil: remember if someone tries to kill you they are most likely bandits 
15:26:44 : Side: Turmoil: you dont loose humanity if you kill bandits :) im also hero btw, welcome to the club
15:27:03 : Side: Arne: if i see a player at a mission i mostly shoot on sight because statistically they will kill me if they saw me
15:27:11 : Side: freedom: right yeah a bandit i will shoot on sight but all other skins ill talk
15:27:23 : Side: Arne: however if they start talking or something i am always up for teaming
15:27:42 : Side: Paul: ok, thanks :)
15:28:05 : Side: Turmoil: personally when i see anyone i always give a warning that im there, might shot a single warning shot in the ground infront of them just to let em know
15:28:19 : Side: Turmoil: if they dont respond or start shooting i answer back with firepower ^^
15:29:21 : Side: Arne: that guy matsa. do you consider him a bandit?
15:29:38 : Side: freedom: nope he helped me out heck of a guy
15:29:55 : Side: Arne: he kamikazeed me at airraft trader last night
15:29:57 : Side: Turmoil: best way to see if anyone is bandit is to go into the servers webpage and check the scoreboards :P
15:30:16 : Side: freedom: hes a hero you sure it was him 
15:30:21 : Side: Arne: yes.'
15:30:38 : Side: freedom: thats odd
15:30:43 : Side: Arne: he even made you mom jokes later on. doesnt seem very heroic
15:31:08 : Side: freedom: what time was this i was onlast night all night and most of day
15:31:26 : Side: Arne: like 2 am
15:31:35 : Side: freedom: and he dont talk much
15:31:47 : Side: Turmoil: matsa is among top 10 human killers
15:32:16 : Side: Arne: sure.. it does not matter at all
15:32:22 : Side: freedom: really? man he hooked me up with some fuel barrels other night flew them to me even
15:32:35 : Side: Arne: weird
15:32:37 : Side: Turmoil: well, human killer doesnt mean he is bandit at all tho
15:32:48 : Side: Turmoil: you get human kills at missions also 
15:33:02 : Side: Turmoil: but thats the only scoreboard he shows up on 
15:33:20 : Side: Arne: that aint bad
15:33:26 : Side: freedom: he does missions alot mostly and prolly killing other bandit players
15:33:28 : Side: Turmoil: well there is your answer, he is bandit
15:33:44 : Side: Arne: i dont mind kamikazees honestly. but it seems childish to me
15:33:58 : Side: freedom: if he kills bandits your saying hes a bandit?
15:34:03 : Side: Turmoil: thanks for settling that one old admin man 
15:34:12 : Side: Turmoil: if he kills heroes and players he is bandit
15:34:46 : Side: Turmoil: ill be right back, my girlfriend is doing some electrical work in her car... requires my assistance
15:34:49 : Side: Arne: i know the game has a very black and white way to look at heros and bandits, but to me it is more nuanced.
15:35:10 : Side: freedom: figured a hero is supposed to kill bandit players
15:35:55 : Side: Arne: i am just trying to survive. which have made me a bandit in the eyes of this game. However i do not kill everybody. 
15:36:08 : Side: Arne: mostly i kill peple who in some way have killed me first or raied my base
15:36:51 : Side: freedom: i just started the game 2 weeks ago and been on this server about 4 days only at +3500
15:37:25 : Side: Arne: that is good. but eve hero AI shoot firsts sometimes, so why should they be considered bad to kill
15:38:06 : Side: freedom: i agree other server i played alot teamed up with bandits and pointed you out made it hard
15:38:45 : Side: freedom: wasent playing epocj though
15:39:13 : Side: Arne: gotta go. seey you guys later.. 
15:39:21 : Side: freedom: later man
15:42:06 : Side: Turmoil: i stick to hero no matter what, im at 29k humanity now ^^
15:42:29 : Side: freedom: whos in military truck
15:42:55 : Side: Turmoil: no clue
15:48:29 : Side: Turmoil: damn trees ¬®

16:04:31 : Side: Paul: will they attack me ?
16:04:33 : Side: Turmoil: yes
16:04:36 : Side: freedom: yes
16:04:40 : Side: Paul: shit
16:04:53 : Side: Paul: if I kill them, do I lose humanity ?
16:04:54 : Side: freedom: good shots too
16:05:09 : Side: Topor: it depends
16:05:15 : Side: Topor: they can be heroes
16:05:18 : Side: Topor: or bandits
16:05:38 : Side: Paul: is there no neutral ones ?
16:05:47 : Side: Turmoil: not AIs
16:05:54 : Side: Topor: i don't think so
16:06:02 : Side: Paul: and if they are heroes, will they shoot me ? I'm neutral
16:06:15 : Side: freedom: all ai will shoot you
16:06:21 : Side: Topor: yep
