14:05:12 : Side: 2DIE4:  i see no flag
14:05:28 : Side: Turmoil: i dont see any flag and i dont remember the exact location of it... i just see it every now and then when i fly over it

14:28:43 : Side: 2DIE4:  i am off
14:33:19 : Side: matsa: like what did you do?
14:33:39 : Side: 2DIE4:  ? 
14:33:44 : Side: 2DIE4:   wha tdo u mean  ?
14:33:47 : Side: matsa: did you kamikaze?
14:34:53 : Side: 2DIE4:  i parked the plane very close to the wall .. so it would dmg it .. but when i untowed it jumped kinda in the base exploded instantly and killed me to
14:35:22 : Side: matsa: sounds more like glitching
14:35:58 : Side: 2DIE4:  naa dude i dont glitch in .. i try all legal ways to get in the base but i dont glitch
14:36:31 : Side: 2DIE4:  even the camo net let me in with a mozzi#
14:36:46 : Side: matsa: i understand if you weren't doing it, but it sounds so shady xD
14:37:18 : Side: 2DIE4:  the only time i glitched on this server was in my own base by accident
14:37:32 : Side: 2DIE4:  parked too close to the wall got out and was outside my base
14:39:13 : Side: matsa: btw
14:39:23 : Side: 2DIE4: yes?
14:39:40 : Side: matsa: everyone check your plot pole
14:39:50 : Side: 2DIE4:  ok   whats up?
14:40:01 : Side: matsa: there were 2-4 hackers here yesterday
14:40:07 : Side: 2DIE4:    ok 
14:40:16 : Side: 2DIE4:  i might have shot one 
14:40:38 : Side: 2DIE4:  whats with the plot?
14:41:02 : Side: matsa: they teleported inside bases and tried to steal them
14:41:13 : Side: 2DIE4:  ill check
14:45:12 : Side: 2DIE4: mine s fine thx 4 the heads  up
15:06:57 : Side: Arne: so how did you manage to take it back?
15:07:05 : Side: matsa: ez
15:07:24 : Side: matsa: what do you mean?
15:07:43 : Side: Arne: the green mountain base
15:08:07 : Side: matsa: glitched in ofc :P
15:08:35 : Side: Arne: what do you mean glicthed?
15:08:46 : Side: matsa: nothing
15:09:03 : Side: matsa: why do you ask?
15:09:13 : Side: Arne: i am interested to know honestly
15:09:45 : Side: matsa: well, try to figure it out and ill say if its correct.
15:10:33 : Side: Arne: I dont really use glitches. So not sure
15:10:40 : Side: matsa: me neither
15:10:58 : Side: Arne: but you said you glicthed in ez
15:11:07 : Side: matsa: i was kidding
15:11:39 : Side: Arne: i havent destroyd the back wall, if you knocked the building down, the plot would be inaccesible
15:11:45 : Side: Arne: you havent*
15:11:56 : Side: matsa: i wrote '':P'' at the end which implied i was sarcastic
15:12:46 : Side: Arne: so the wall didnt go down, the building didnt go down. I guess you could have wrecked the front door?
15:13:10 : Side: matsa: no
15:14:17 : Side: Arne: ok. did you knock down the building?
15:14:25 : Side: matsa: no
15:14:36 : Side: Arne: did you come through the roof
15:14:55 : Side: matsa: i cant come trough the roof, you removed the ladder
15:15:17 : Side: Arne: ok.. so you would have to glitch the walls
15:15:24 : Side: matsa: still no
15:15:44 : Side: Arne: did you somehow get into the window
15:15:48 : Side: matsa: no
15:16:02 : Side: Arne: well are you lying right now?
15:16:08 : Side: matsa: no
15:16:28 : Side: Arne: there arent any other ways besides doing a wall hack
15:16:34 : Side: Arne: which i know you havent done
15:16:50 : Side: matsa: there is
15:16:50 : Side: Arne: or teleport
15:17:31 : Side: Arne: well dont hold out on me then. because i do not believe there is
15:19:03 : Side: matsa: there is a way, many people just dont realize it
15:19:24 : Side: matsa: because they havent played the game/server for that long
15:19:50 : Side: Paul: is it specific to this server ?
15:19:56 : Side: Arne: so you are telling me you got into the heavy secure plot, without breaking the doors or the building, or use glitches.
15:20:19 : Side: matsa: ye
15:20:35 : Side: Arne: yeah somehow i dont believe you.
15:20:44 : Side: matsa: you dont need to
15:21:16 : Side: Arne: i guess not. q
15:21:33 : Side: Paul: but I wanted to know :P
15:21:39 : Side: Arne: he glitched paul
15:21:49 : Side: Paul: well, that's what I was thinking
15:21:58 : Side: Arne: he is just a troller
15:22:11 : Side: Paul: as soon as he said "I glitched", I didn't believe it to be a joke
15:22:13 : Side: matsa: right
15:22:34 : Side: Paul: looks like the only way to prove us wrong is to reveal how you did, now :)
15:23:18 : Side: matsa: play longer and you too will know
15:23:30 : Side: Arne: LWB is it conisdered illigal to take over somebodys base by glitching the walls?
15:23:41 : Side: matsa: didnt glitch :)
15:23:49 : Side: Arne: right
15:23:54 : Side: Paul: I'm pretty sure I read it somewhere on the server
15:24:03 : Side: Arne: it would be wouldnt it
15:24:19 : Side: LWB [SD]: matsa, show me please. Considering your gorup has history with glitching/ Patri..sorry Pheatta was banned for it remember
15:24:34 : Side: Arne: can we all meet at green mountain
15:24:39 : Side: Paul: Just to be sure, Matsa went in your base, Arne ?
15:24:53 : Side: Arne: because if you did do it legally i would like to know, so i dont consider youq
15:24:59 : Side: Arne: a bad person
15:25:24 : Side: matsa: im here
15:25:54 : Side: Paul: matsa, are you currently in Arne's base ?

16:25:55 : Side: Paul: was just passing by
16:26:16 : Side: Arne: put your on the office building door
16:26:16 : Side: Paul: I was going from A to B and I saw this strange building
16:26:27 : Side: Paul: You won't shoot me ? :)
16:26:40 : Side: Arne: i am flying off. need to do some things
16:27:26 : Side: Paul: Your base looks great
16:27:38 : Side: Arne: actually matsa and the dudes did the building
16:27:50 : Side: Paul: what happened ?
16:27:55 : Side: LWB [SD]: Altar? Dont you mean 2die4
16:28:02 : Side: Arne: he gave me the plot
16:28:07 : Side: LWB [SD]: he did?
16:28:10 : Side: Arne: yes
16:28:12 : Side: yavvs: 2die4 hasn't built the base?
16:28:26 : Side: Paul: Can I land on the roof ?
16:28:28 : Side: LWB [SD]: he buildt this base at altar
16:28:45 : Side: yavvs: maybe in the pasts
16:29:11 : Side: LWB [SD]: he was working on it yesterday
16:29:17 : Side: LWB [SD]: and his name is on all the doors
16:29:22 : Side: yavvs: 2DIE4?!
16:29:26 : Side: Turmoil: xD
16:29:31 : Side: LWB [SD]: yes
16:29:32 : Side: Paul: So can I land on the roof ?
16:30:05 : Side: Arne: on my base?
16:30:09 : Side: Paul: yes
16:30:23 : Side: Arne: sure but there is no way in from the roof
16:30:36 : Side: Paul: thanks :)
16:30:37 : Side: yavvs: Yesterday, matsa and arna was the only guys with access to the door
16:30:45 : Side: yavvs: were
16:30:56 : Side: Arne: i didnt have acces?
16:31:05 : Side: LWB [SD]: 2die4s base on altar has his name on all the doors, plus some doors have the rest of his group on
16:31:05 : Side: Arne: well at the beginning maybe :)
16:31:08 : Side: yavvs: well then, only matsa had access!
16:31:40 : Side: yavvs: matsa was the only guy with still code access 
16:31:51 : Side: Arne: aarh 
16:31:57 : Side: Arne: im such a retard
16:32:03 : Side: Arne: lol
16:32:12 : Side: Arne: simple yetr elegant
16:32:21 : Side: yavvs: after Arne overtook the base, removed matsa from plot, he was the only one with access at that time
16:32:39 : Side: Arne: i thought the codes reset honestly
16:32:48 : Side: yavvs: matsa was then quick to get back to the base, as he still had access to the doors, as he was the original owner
16:33:20 : Side: yavvs: matsa then cleaned the base, removing all previous members in both plot/doors
16:33:31 : Side: yavvs: there was NOBODY else on those lists last night
16:33:37 : Side: matsa: Admin, can i have a refund of my mozzie, my game crashed.
16:33:45 : Side: LWB [SD]: everysingle door has 2dies4 name on it. Are we talking about the same place here
16:33:56 : Side: LWB [SD]: altar, the huge base of 2die4
16:33:57 : Side: yavvs: M
16:33:58 : Side: yavvs: GM
16:34:00 : Side: LWB [SD]: that has always been his

16:34:41 : Side: LWB [SD]: but this guy paul is on 2die4 base
16:34:46 : Side: LWB [SD]: which we were talking about
16:35:12 : Side: Paul: speaking of which, I can't access my mozzie on this magnifiscent roof
16:35:27 : Side: yavvs: so Paul, you play with 2DIE4?

21:25:42 : Side: Paul: oh ok
21:25:47 : Side: Paul: why that ?
21:25:48 : Side: Joshuaa: damn
21:25:58 : Side: Winans: joke...
21:26:02 : Side: Joshuaa: only asking to help dude
21:26:04 : Side: Winans: raiding pobeda dam base atm...
21:26:09 : Side: Winans: you can do the mission paul
21:26:18 : Side: Paul: ok
21:26:26 : Side: Joshuaa: wow we got so many vehicles haha
21:26:29 : Side: Paul: you scared me, kinda made me think again
21:26:31 : Side: yavvs: :DD
21:26:37 : Side: yavvs: hell yeah josh
21:27:01 : Side: matsa: Admin? can you check out Phaetta's ban appeal now?
21:27:44 : Side: LWB [SD]: He is not being unbanned. He glitched into a base whilst I was stood there
21:28:17 : Side: matsa: He logged in
21:29:11 : Side: matsa: right at that moment when you were looking at him, he logged in
21:29:26 : Side: LWB [SD]: well how did he get in there in the first place?
21:29:33 : Side: LWB [SD]: a cmpletely locked and sealed room
21:30:47 : Side: LWB [SD]: and thats not true, cos he logged in about 20 mins before he got there. I already checked that one out ;-)
21:31:49 : Side: yavvs: phaetta's game crashed while midair, causing him to be being on the ground when logging in. this occured about 20 mins later, and he appeared in the
21:31:50 : Side: yavvs: base
21:31:58 : Side: Paul: when you said I should take out the M2 guy first
21:32:05 : Side: Paul: is it a bipod thing ?
21:32:16 : Side: Joshuaa: yah
21:32:29 : Side: Turmoil: the M2 are the guys that stands with the stationary machine gun mounted on a tripod
21:32:37 : Side: yavvs: he has written an appeal, as he as a kid is to be believing that he glitched because of this.
21:32:47 : Side: Turmoil: best is to take them out first, they are very accurate and can easily kill you up to a 1000m
21:33:17 : Side: yavvs: if there is no evidence for this, your ban is invalid and should be reconsidered
21:33:34 : Side: LWB [SD]: I have all the evidence. The ban stands
21:33:35 : Side: yavvs: lwb, i want you to take a stand in this discussion, as I really want to hear your opinion
21:33:37 : Side: matsa: or atleast not be permanent
21:33:40 : Side: yavvs: what kind of evidence?
21:33:45 : Side: yavvs: your login/logout log?
21:33:52 : Side: yavvs: lastlocation?
21:33:58 : Side: yavvs: it does not stand as a good enough evidence
21:33:59 : Side: LWB [SD]: This wont be discussed further on here, if you have an issue, go the website
21:34:35 : Side: yavvs: it will not help, as you as the admin of the server does not correspond to answer any ban appeal
21:34:52 : Side: LWB [SD]: I havent had a chance yet.. 
21:35:01 : Side: LWB [SD]: I would suggest you drop the subject
21:35:10 : Side: yavvs: will you ban me if I try to take this up?
21:35:14 : Side: yavvs: ingame?
21:35:32 : Side: LWB [SD]: I have told you to take it to the website
21:36:26 : Side: yavvs: I do understand that, but can you tell me what kind of evidence you hav? 
21:36:42 : Side: Turmoil: omg dude take it to the website, not everyone on this server need to know this
21:36:48 : Side: Turmoil: or read about it
21:36:52 : Side: yavvs: this is not your cause
21:36:59 : Side: matsa: you dont need to read
21:37:31 : Side: Turmoil: *thumbs up*
21:41:26 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: i miss a kind of armed cargo truck (madmx style) :P 
21:42:35 : Side: matsa: ill take it to the website, what do you want me to write?
21:42:49 : Side: matsa: just arguments or?
21:44:00 : Side: LWB [SD]: provide your proof he didnt glitch, even though he already admitted he did
21:45:08 : Side: yavvs: did he admit how he glitched in to the base?
21:45:20 : Side: LWB [SD]: doesnt matter. He glitched.. thats it
21:46:39 : Side: yavvs: as in arma, whenever you're midair when a crash occours, your Y position is set to 0.
21:47:10 : Side: yavvs: if you can deny that, we will shut up
21:47:17 : Side: LWB [SD]: we all know that didnt happen/ Please stop lying. I checked the logs, he logged in at a different location at least 20 minutes before
21:47:51 : Side: LWB [SD]: Please do not continue to argue with me, because it will not end well for you. I caught him, get over it
21:48:10 : Side: Cristi: If you are talking about my base that just got raided by yvvs with the merlin and hawk, yes, it's really easy to glitch into.
21:48:32 : Side: Cristi: He probably got into the open humvee through the wall, then in order to exit just walked in front of the SUV and you get thrown out.
21:48:41 : Side: LWB [SD]: we are not talking about that
21:48:48 : Side: Cristi: ok :D, sorry. 
21:48:50 : Side: LWB [SD]: this was about 2 weeks ago
21:48:51 : Side: yavvs: there you go; he logged in from another position 20 minutes ago, and ended up to be crashing right outside 2DIE4's base
21:48:57 : Side: LWB [SD]: and I saw it happen with my own eyes
21:49:15 : Side: yavvs: Cristi, if you're base is up north of lopatino, your roof was unprotected
21:49:27 : Side: Cristi: Mhm, it was a shit base. I thought it was about that.
21:49:28 : Side: yavvs: you had a hummer open for access, and a locked suv
21:49:34 : Side: yavvs: i flew down with a mozzy
21:49:40 : Side: yavvs: removed your plot, replaced it
21:49:55 : Side: yavvs: then removed added me to the codelocks and drove off
21:50:02 : Side: Cristi: gg
21:50:51 : Side: yavvs: so no, without any PROPER proof(everyone), any argument is valueless
21:51:02 : Side: LWB [SD]: you want me to post the logs?
21:51:09 : Side: yavvs: yes, please.
21:51:18 : Side: LWB [SD]: remind me what date it was
21:51:25 : Side: yavvs: I cant remember?
21:51:28 : Side: LWB [SD]: well then..
21:51:29 : Side: yavvs: let me check
21:56:20 : Side: SeregaKGB: camping trade zone? is this normal?
21:56:49 : Side: yavvs: LWB, he is hardly trying to find out
21:57:01 : Side: yavvs: you can just search for his name
21:57:19 : Side: LWB [SD]: I have over 500 log files with hundreds of his name...
21:57:32 : Side: LWB [SD]: ypur proove he didnt... why should I waste time prooving he did
21:57:36 : Side: SeregaKGB: stand on the border of the safe zone and shoot anyone who leaves?
21:57:37 : Side: LWB [SD]: drop it NOW
21:57:55 : Side: yavvs: because you're an admin? you are supposed to help people with in these situations
21:58:17 : Side: Paul: Actually, you came at me with your bike, it scared me
21:58:21 : Side: Paul: I'm sorry
21:58:33 : Side: Turmoil: *clap clap clap*
