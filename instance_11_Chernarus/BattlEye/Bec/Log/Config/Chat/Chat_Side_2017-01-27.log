00:28:39 : Side: Paul: I asked it 3 hours ago
00:28:56 : Side: Fedequeso: is a kind of mission ?
00:29:01 : Side: Paul: When you leave a vehicle in a safe zone when the server restarts, it teleports there
00:29:10 : Side: Fedequeso: oooh nice
00:29:15 : Side: Paul: So you can get it back
00:29:29 : Side: Fedequeso: lock it or unlockit ?
00:30:07 : Side: Paul: wether the car is locked or not, it will get teleported
00:30:27 : Side: Paul: But I believe the lock will be the same that when you left it
00:30:38 : Side: Fedequeso: i mean when the car is teleported gets unlockit ?
00:30:41 : Side: Fedequeso: ah ok
00:30:45 : Side: Fedequeso: thanks c:
