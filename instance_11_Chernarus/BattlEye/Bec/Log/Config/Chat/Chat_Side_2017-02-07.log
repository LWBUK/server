09:44:15 : Side: Echo: are they enemies of you?
09:44:40 : Side: Turmoil: all the big bases in the server has safes wich is undestructible, so wont get much from raiding them, should go for the small ones :D
09:44:54 : Side: Turmoil: not really, i had a few discussions with them but i dont consider them enemies
09:45:01 : Side: Turmoil: i dont consider anyone enemies actually
09:46:02 : Side: Echo: holy shit, i hit you and now from +2000 humanity to -1000

09:50:15 : Side: Echo: like a litle castle
09:50:38 : Side: Turmoil: yeah their not bad
09:51:59 : Side: Turmoil: they were talking about doing a giveaway of the bases later on so
09:52:41 : Side: Echo: i want it^^ batter than my base, only a box of metallfloors with a door
09:53:21 : Side: Turmoil: i prefere to build my own base tho, think its better and i feel like i appreciate it more if i actually work for it ^^
09:53:52 : Side: Echo: yeah, thats right, but my base looks like shit
09:54:20 : Side: Turmoil: rebuild it? ^^a
09:54:36 : Side: Echo: hmmm
09:55:39 : Side: Turmoil: find a good spot and build it just like you want it ^^
09:55:56 : Side: Echo: hmm, no money and no building supplys
09:56:28 : Side: Turmoil: do missions ^^
09:57:06 : Side: Echo: yeah, but at the last mission there where a player with a BTR or domething
09:58:00 : Side: Turmoil: bring lots of ammo and you can take down anything
10:00:04 : Side: Turmoil: any luck getting in? ;)
10:00:18 : Side: Echo: ^^
10:01:20 : Side: Turmoil: only one way to get in, you need to remove a wall... 
10:01:41 : Side: Echo: which aremd vehicle is the best for this?
10:02:00 : Side: Turmoil: anyone with a gun pretty much, as long as you can afford the ammo for it and have the patience
10:02:03 : Side: Turmoil: takes alot of bullets
10:02:13 : Side: Echo: ok

15:54:45 : Side: 2DIE4:  nope u cant i have a plot  Xd
15:54:55 : Side: 2DIE4:  theres always a way down  Xd
15:55:15 : Side: Turmoil: i fell down from your base that time when i camped on your helipad and lost connection :O
15:55:15 : Side: 2DIE4:   i would have jumped and go back there grab my shit  again  
15:55:17 : Side: Echo: yes, but 5 min before restart i wont jump down your base
15:55:30 : Side: 2DIE4:  naa true  
15:55:32 : Side: Turmoil: i survived too
15:55:34 : Side: Echo: but i really like the vss
15:56:14 : Side: Echo: but well played turmoil
15:57:39 : Side: Echo: but it was a lot of work to get my base back, sds clan captured my base and i have to shoot with an mk mod 2 doors down
15:57:53 : Side: 2DIE4:  so hail / echo  ... did u raid my shit?
15:58:04 : Side: Echo: after the 240 mgs was empty i have to use pkp
15:58:11 : Side: Echo: no
15:58:29 : Side: 2DIE4:  well lso it was  mario ... 
15:58:41 : Side: 2DIE4:  anyone interested in a raidparty?
15:58:41 : Side: Echo: was only really unlucky that you were there after restart
15:58:59 : Side: Echo: yes ^^
15:59:01 : Side: 2DIE4:  well shit happens   .... but u got my stuff thats ok
15:59:35 : Side: Echo: i like vss ^^
15:59:47 : Side: Echo: it my lucille now
15:59:57 : Side: 2DIE4:  dont need a sidearm no more  =9
16:03:11 : Side: Echo: but the sds guys are not very clever, the placed the plot in the middle of the room in my base not behind a door or bugged into a wall
16:03:36 : Side: Turmoil: probably becouse a plotpole inside a wall or safe is illegal 
16:04:26 : Side: Echo: yeah, but  i am not sure hoe they get the plot without destroying any wall or door
16:04:50 : Side: Echo: they only removed tanktraps, think they glitched in
16:04:53 : Side: Turmoil: i was on when they did the baseraid... they used an armed helicopter and shot down walls and even crashed and died
16:04:57 : Side: 2DIE4:  u know u can figure the codes from the locks right
16:05:28 : Side: Turmoil: so if all walls were there when you saw it, they must have replaced them
16:05:42 : Side: Echo: yeah, but they have to get throw 2 doors minimum
16:05:55 : Side: 2DIE4:  just saying
16:06:24 : Side: Turmoil: no problem if you can shoot em with M134 or a .50 cal... but what they did inside i do not know... i just saw them when i was in the woods heading 
16:06:28 : Side: Turmoil: to NWAF
16:07:13 : Side: Turmoil: i was not about to stay around to chat whit an armed heli all alone :P 
16:07:31 : Side: Echo: next time you shoot pls
16:07:42 : Side: Turmoil: i will, lol
16:08:03 : Side: Echo: after i reclaimed my base i had after restart everwhere 3 doors
16:08:08 : Side: Echo: in 1
16:08:23 : Side: Turmoil: but i never shoot unless im 100% sure its bandits or i get shot upon... one of the side effects of playing hero i guess
16:08:46 : Side: Echo: at the same snappoint 3 doors is bullshit, i need hours to fix that
16:10:11 : Side: 2DIE4:  ahahahaha
16:10:19 : Side: Turmoil: the force is strong with this one, yes
16:10:22 : Side: Turmoil: xD
16:10:49 : Side: Turmoil: dang it, my scroll is weird... -_-
16:10:55 : Side: Turmoil: brb
16:11:13 : Side: Echo: where are you from turmoil?
16:11:14 : Side: 2DIE4: ???
16:12:37 : Side: Echo: 2die4 you are german right?
16:12:44 : Side: 2DIE4:  affirmative
16:13:10 : Side: Echo: all right
16:13:23 : Side: Echo: sds too!?
16:13:38 : Side: 2DIE4:  yap they r
16:14:22 : Side: Echo: this rule to use your vehicle every 3 days is new!?
16:14:48 : Side: 2DIE4: yea
16:15:47 : Side: Echo: i dont like that rule
16:16:37 : Side: Echo: i am not sure if sds destroyed my suv or if its gone cause of the new rule
16:16:53 : Side: Echo: sry lwb?
16:16:53 : Side: Turmoil: do you have the key for it?
16:17:01 : Side: 2DIE4: dunno+
16:17:15 : Side: Echo: no more, but i checked it, its gone
16:17:52 : Side: Turmoil: well, if it doesnt show up when you locate it its destroyed or sold unfortunatly
16:18:31 : Side: Echo: yes, i know, but like i said, not sure if it is deleted destroyed or sold
16:19:37 : Side: Turmoil: well, if they raided your base im gonna go for destroyed... since i do know they crashed a helicopter while doing it
16:19:48 : Side: Turmoil: mostly the stuff inside goes to kingdomcome when that happens
16:20:00 : Side: Echo: :/
16:20:25 : Side: Turmoil: i had a couple of heli crashes ontop of my base and the vehicles inside almost always go to hell when that happens
16:21:01 : Side: Echo: maybe some small holes in the roof, between 2 floors
16:21:51 : Side: Echo: cause of this i am pushing the everytime a little bit into each other
16:22:30 : Side: Turmoil: well, i think no matter what you do arma will be arma... thing will go to hell no matter what :P
16:22:51 : Side: Echo: and why you was at my base today????
16:23:16 : Side: Turmoil: like i said... just chechking if it had been raided, since Winans said he wanted to give it away
16:23:30 : Side: Echo: hmm, ok
16:23:49 : Side: Turmoil: did you think i was gonna break an entry with a mozzie perhaps?
16:24:06 : Side: Echo: maybe ^^
16:24:32 : Side: Turmoil: lol... got no reason for it... i hate base raiding, i prefere missions, more challange than shooting a brick wall 
16:24:48 : Side: Echo: thats true ^^
16:25:02 : Side: Turmoil: anyone gotten the C130 i marked on the map btw? :O
16:25:11 : Side: Echo: but i didnt build my base for defending, mostly only for the look
16:25:18 : Side: Echo: no
16:25:48 : Side: Turmoil: i just build mine for a place for the safes and a little cosy place were i can actually take 5 mins to make a sandwich without getting my head blown 
16:25:50 : Side: Turmoil: off xD
16:26:04 : Side: Turmoil: and not having to logg out
