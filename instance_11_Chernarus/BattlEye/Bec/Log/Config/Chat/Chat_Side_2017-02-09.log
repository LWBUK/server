13:16:11 : Side: Turmoil: yeah ^^ im not alone anymore <3
13:17:09 : Side: Hailstorm: that wasnt super hero like...
13:19:10 : Side: Turmoil: lol
13:19:22 : Side: Hailstorm: what?
13:19:23 : Side: Turmoil: superhero doesnt mean bulletproof tho xD
13:19:35 : Side: Hailstorm: :(
13:20:18 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: and i jumped to turmail to catch the bullet
13:23:40 : Side: Hailstorm: my wall have after 3 days 11% damage, bullshit
13:24:02 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: when you maintain your plotepole its gone.. 
13:24:25 : Side: Hailstorm: i know, but i can do this every 3 - 4 days
13:24:33 : Side: Hailstorm: not 7
13:24:54 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: you dont have its more a warning system for the 7day thing
13:25:30 : Side: Hailstorm: hmmm... but they have 11% damage :(
13:25:48 : Side: Turmoil: that happens after like 3 days
13:25:54 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: yea at 100% it disapeer// 
13:26:38 : Side: Hailstorm: after the 7 days are there instand at 100% damage?
13:26:54 : Side: Turmoil: nah, takes a while to get to 100% and disapear
13:27:06 : Side: Hailstorm: ok, thx
13:27:53 : Side: Hailstorm: hope the admins will change this 3 day vehicle despawn shit
13:28:06 : Side: Hailstorm: 7 are ok, but 3
13:28:30 : Side: Turmoil: i think its good... becouse everybody have so many vehicles its insane... slows down the performance of the server
13:28:58 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: and the randome vihicle spawns also
13:29:14 : Side: Hailstorm: yeah, but i didnt see the difference between now and before, my fps are still the same
13:29:31 : Side: Hailstorm: and my viewdistance is at 4000m
13:29:36 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: its to the fps thing but the vehicle cap
13:29:48 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: its not fps i mean
13:30:15 : Side: Hailstorm: what do you mean with vehicle cap?
13:30:36 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: servers have a vehicle cap,.. 
13:30:44 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: so
13:30:52 : Side: Turmoil: the server only holds 400 vehicles... 
13:30:58 : Side: Hailstorm: oh u mean capacity?
13:31:05 : Side: Turmoil: yeah
13:31:07 : Side: Hailstorm: ^^
13:31:24 : Side: Hailstorm: you can turn it up....
13:31:36 : Side: Turmoil: but then it slows the server down :)
13:31:45 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: so if ppl keep buying and storing vechiles, and it will be over the 400.. then the server get a hard time.. 
13:32:01 : Side: Hailstorm: :( my pc is strong enough to do this..
13:32:19 : Side: [NG2] Jesse: and there will be no wild randome helis and cars anymore
13:32:59 : Side: Hailstorm: hmmm, but 3 days is to less... think 7 days are better or 5
13:33:43 : Side: Turmoil: you also need to remember that your computer is not hosting the server, you are merely logging into it :)
13:33:58 : Side: Hailstorm: :/
13:34:37 : Side: Turmoil: so you dont need a strong computer to play on the server, but you need very good bandwith and hardware to run the server itself
13:34:54 : Side: Hailstorm: :(
13:35:35 : Side: Hailstorm: but i dont want to buy expensive vehicles, cause i am scared that i lose them
13:36:02 : Side: Turmoil: just logg in every 3 day at least and unlock start em and lock em :)
13:36:20 : Side: Hailstorm: :(
13:36:48 : Side: Hailstorm: i know myself, i will forget it after the second or third time
14:05:52 : Side: Alonso: hail
