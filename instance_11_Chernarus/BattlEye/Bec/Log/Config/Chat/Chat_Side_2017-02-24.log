10:47:48 : Side: 2DIE4:  4 the new ones     XD one topaz = 7 BCw
10:48:55 : Side: Turmoil: just curious, guess someone glitched into the base or something and got em, but i was pretty sure non of them were reset ^^ ah well
10:49:13 : Side: 2DIE4: anything good in it?
10:49:39 : Side: Turmoil: 3 safes whit building supplies and 3 safes whit misc guns are gone
10:49:49 : Side: Turmoil: money and sniper safes are still there 
10:50:16 : Side: 2DIE4: well the safes u use the most r still there 
10:50:44 : Side: 2DIE4:  so i guess u didnt maintain the others 4 some time ... and its hard to tell when u just iscan 
10:51:09 : Side: Turmoil: yep, but i had Jesse check all of them whit 0000 and then i replaced all of those which was reset :) and i opened all safes 5 days ago 
10:51:24 : Side: Turmoil: always open all safes whit 5 day interwalls to be sure i dont exceed the 7 day
10:51:38 : Side: 2DIE4:  u should get in contact with LWB    to figure it out
10:52:10 : Side: Turmoil: im not too worried about it :) i got money so, but others might just not be so happy about it, lol
10:52:10 : Side: 2DIE4: its not only open them ...!!!!!  be aware!   u have to change the content as well  one item at least!
10:52:26 : Side: Turmoil: well that might be it then
10:52:42 : Side: 2DIE4:  learnd som new   =) 
10:53:01 : Side: Turmoil: yep, tho it still means someone is deliberatly glitchng into my base ^^ that i dont like
