18:04:25 : Side: BaffledBambi: im logging no
18:04:29 : Side: BaffledBambi: food! :D
18:06:38 : Side: Luca: what is the real name of the DMR?
18:07:11 : Side: 2DIE4:  this one dont know DMR is  4 many weapons
18:07:20 : Side: 2DIE4:  DMR= Designated Marks Man
18:07:51 : Side: 2DIE4:  so the DMR can be either a M14  or   any other Rifle with sniping capabilities
18:08:14 : Side: Luca: ok. but the rifle here named DMR?
18:15:43 : Side: 2DIE4:  i think its a modified M14 --- due to the reliability of that weapon   it got more stiff and gunhandle buttstock ...  but dont nail me 4 it
18:16:39 : Side: 2DIE4: but maybe if u check Days wiki   it ight give u more background info about it
18:16:45 : Side: Luca: yes, youre right! i'have saw on google :)
18:16:49 : Side: Luca: now
18:17:18 : Side: Luca: its name is M14 DMR
18:17:19 : Side: 2DIE4:  i am right what?   about the M14 model with reshaped frame and buttsock?
18:17:25 : Side: 2DIE4:  =) damn im good  XD
18:17:27 : Side: Luca: yes
18:17:33 : Side: 2DIE4:  never really checked on it .. 
18:17:39 : Side: Luca: :)
18:17:58 : Side: Luca: its an old rifle remodernized
18:18:07 : Side: Luca: cool
18:18:09 : Side: 2DIE4: yap
18:18:59 : Side: Luca: i've found on Arma 2 official site :)
18:19:13 : Side: 2DIE4:  always worth checking =) 
18:19:37 : Side: Luca: :)
18:20:04 : Side: 2DIE4: LW
18:20:08 : Side: Luca: now food is fixed right?
18:20:15 : Side: 2DIE4:  hows the viewdistance on the  overpoch? 
18:20:24 : Side: LWB [SD]: what do you man by fixed?
18:20:27 : Side: LWB [SD]: mean
18:20:51 : Side: Luca: that fill as before update
18:21:11 : Side: LWB [SD]: no, devs changed it, it was a bug before in 016
18:21:12 : Side: LWB [SD]: 106
18:21:24 : Side: LWB [SD]: viewdistance is same as here on overpoch
18:21:26 : Side: Luca: strange
18:21:32 : Side: 2DIE4: damn 
18:21:32 : Side: LWB [SD]: cant go higher as it allows gltiching to easilly
18:22:22 : Side: 2DIE4:  damn  than the CHYtac nearly makes no sense
18:22:33 : Side: Luca: i've played in a server before coming here and it was 1.0.6 and the food was like here now
18:22:33 : Side: LWB [SD]: you can still 3000m
18:22:53 : Side: 2DIE4: but rendering stops at 1,5
18:22:58 : Side: 2DIE4: 2.5
18:23:38 : Side: Luca: i've thinked you admins edited the food fill
18:23:47 : Side: LWB [SD]: I have not touched the food
18:23:52 : Side: LWB [SD]: the epoch devs touched the food
18:23:56 : Side: LWB [SD]: as it was wrong in 106
18:24:02 : Side: LWB [SD]: it was never meant to fill you up
18:24:19 : Side: Luca: ok. but was pretty :)
18:25:04 : Side: Luca: now i've to eat like a pig!! XD
18:25:12 : Side: 2DIE4:  go hunt
18:25:52 : Side: Luca: now 3-4 bacon to fill
18:26:02 : Side: Luca: :)
18:28:10 : Side: LWB [SD]: even at 5000 view you cant see 4000m anyway, need to be 7000 before you can see anything further than 4 then fps nosedives
18:29:05 : Side: Luca: admin in my base is vanished another gun rack... i dont know how, i've mainteined yesterday
18:30:47 : Side: LWB [SD]: I dont know why. all I can suggest is they dont get mainatined when you maintain, although they should. If you actually use them, then its impossible
18:31:15 : Side: LWB [SD]: every time you use something it updates the date, nothing can be delted unless it hasnt been touched for a certain period of time
18:31:27 : Side: LWB [SD]: so you cant have used it in more than 2 weeks
18:31:43 : Side: Luca: no, i've used
18:32:03 : Side: Luca: yesterday i've done force maintain
18:32:16 : Side: 2DIE4: well u need to be precise on that one LW .. u need to "update" the value of the container... either box, or rack or safe ... 
18:32:26 : Side: 2DIE4:  simply open and close wont do the job
18:32:38 : Side: 2DIE4:  u need to add or take some out of it
18:32:44 : Side: LWB [SD]: The rules state USE
18:33:04 : Side: 2DIE4:  i know but some pl get use wrong with eyescan and close again  XD
18:33:09 : Side: Luca: use mean take a gun and reput inside?
18:33:25 : Side: LWB [SD]: yes.. It actually says not just lock unlock
18:33:30 : Side: 2DIE4:  yap or just take  a mag out 
18:33:42 : Side: LWB [SD]: or in the case of canrack, use it.. there is only one eay you can use it
18:33:43 : Side: 2DIE4:  or ad one  
18:34:27 : Side: Luca: boh
18:34:46 : Side: Luca: is a mistery
18:34:46 : Side: 2DIE4:  well gun rack   cant be that much in it
18:35:59 : Side: Luca: i've lost all the rifle inside
18:36:08 : Side: 2DIE4:  5  ? 
18:36:24 : Side: Luca: i dont remember well
18:36:26 : Side: 2DIE4: 5 rifles aint nothing ... dust off your shoulders
18:36:42 : Side: Luca: oh yes
18:37:06 : Side: LWB [SD]: its just not possible for the database to delete anything thatss been used within the last 2 weeks, except vehicles
18:37:13 : Side: LWB [SD]: so I cant explain it
18:37:58 : Side: Luca: so maintain the base dont prevent storage unit to disappear?
18:38:08 : Side: 2DIE4:  no 
18:38:15 : Side: Luca: ok. got it
18:38:20 : Side: LWB [SD]: it should, but some class names arent included it seems
18:38:23 : Side: 2DIE4:  theyx do not  count as buildable items
18:38:42 : Side: Luca: ok. now i keep in mind for next time
18:38:43 : Side: 2DIE4:  i think only if u force maintain
18:39:21 : Side: Luca: ok tx for explaination
18:39:23 : Side: 2DIE4:  if u look at the plotpole  it say maintain 100 items but on the very top it says  100/ 108 for example
18:39:36 : Side: 2DIE4:  the 8 more would be safes or wooden boxes  
18:39:37 : Side: Luca: yes i've noticed
18:39:48 : Side: Luca: ah ok
18:40:13 : Side: 2DIE4: so if u force it maintains the whole thing i think biut still i dont trust it  so i keep using my saes  =) 
18:40:17 : Side: 2DIE4: *safes  =9
18:40:47 : Side: Luca: yesterday i've force maintained and now both numbers are equals
18:40:58 : Side: LWB [SD]: Ive added gunrack and wooden crate to the exclude delete list on the database so now its double impossible for the database to remove them
18:41:11 : Side: Luca: ok. tx!
18:41:46 : Side: Luca: safes do not disappear?
18:44:30 : Side: LWB [SD]: they shouldnt no
18:44:37 : Side: Luca: ok tx
18:50:23 : Side: 2DIE4: oh now u cannot even take plotpoleitems ownership no more
18:50:53 : Side: Luca: no, i've readed is a update
18:51:48 : Side: LWB [SD]: you dont need to
18:52:02 : Side: LWB [SD]: it automaticly assigns buildables to new plotpole person
18:52:12 : Side: 2DIE4:  yap i figured  =9
18:52:17 : Side: LWB [SD]: apperntly
18:52:25 : Side: LWB [SD]: havent tried it though
18:52:32 : Side: 2DIE4:  just got one  XD
18:52:43 : Side: LWB [SD]: is there any bases you dont own xD
18:52:50 : Side: 2DIE4:  hahahaha

19:18:13 : Side: LWB [SD]: yes, but the penalty system is back
19:18:47 : Side: 2DIE4:  what was it ^10 seconds?
19:19:25 : Side: LWB [SD]: its random I believe
